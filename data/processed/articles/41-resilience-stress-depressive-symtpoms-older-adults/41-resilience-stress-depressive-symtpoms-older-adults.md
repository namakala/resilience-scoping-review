Objective: The association between exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) and late-life depression is well-documented.

However, the role of resilience as a buffer against the adverse mental health effects of SLEs in late life has not been convincingly demonstrated. In this paper, the moderating effect of resilience in the relationship between SLEs and depressive symptomatology in older Chinese adults is investigated.

Method: A population sample of 385 community-dwelling older Chinese adults aged 60 years responded to questionnaires on resilience (ConnorDavidson resilience scale), depressive symptomatology (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15) and SLEs.

Results: Increased numbers of SLEs (b D 0.343, p < .001) and lower levels of resilience (b D 0.137, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology. There was a significant interaction of resilience and number of SLEs on depressive symptomatology (p D 0.003). The sense of personal competence and optimism was the principal underlying resilience dimension moderating the relationship for both the youngold (aged 6069) and the oldold (aged 70 and above).

Conclusion: The finding of significant interaction supported the role of resilience in moderating the adverse effect of SLEs in terms of depressive symptoms among older Chinese adults. Keywords: resilience; stressful life events; depressive symptoms; older adults

## Introduction

National surveys have found that the levels of depressive symptoms to be highest in the youngest and oldest adults
(Kessler, Foster, Webster, & House, 1992). Depressive symptoms are indeed highly prevalent among older adults in both Western populations (Beekman, Copeland, &
Prince, 1999; Mirowsky & Ross, 1992) and East Asian populations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. (Lim, et al. 2011) In Singapore, the prevalence rate of depressive symptoms among older Chinese adults was reported to be 13.3% (Niti, Ng, Kua, Ho, & Tan, 2007). Although not always consistent, many studies have found that the oldold presented with higher levels of depressive symptoms than the youngold (e.g. Jeon & Dunkle, 2009).

The association between exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) and late-life depression is well-documented
(Kessler, 1997). SLEs are reportedly associated with higher depression scores in cross-sectional studies
(Colenda & Smith, 1993) and predict increased depressive symptoms in prospective studies of community-dwelling older adults. (Glass, Kasl, & Berkman, 1997).

In studies assessing the link between SLEs and depression, there is evidence that recent life events rather than distally occurring life events have a greater impact on the onset of depressive symptoms (Tennant, 2002). Among older adults, both health-related and non-health related events are linked with depressive symptoms (Bruce, 2002), but there is evidence suggesting that non-health

related SLEs events relating to 'loss' such as death of spouse, friends or relatives, and major conflict with others had the largest impact on depressive symptoms ( De Beurs et al., 2001; Fiske, Gatz, & Pedersen, 2003). Studies show that these are mostly network or non-egocentric events, which have been rated as more stressful than the egocentric ones. (Aldwin, 1990; Kahana & Kahana, 1998).

In studies conducted among older Asian adults, similar findings of the association of SLEs with increased risk of depression are also reported. Recent hospitalization episode(s) have been found to predict subsequent depressive symptoms among older Chinese adults in Singapore (Feng, Yap, Kua, & Ng, 2009).

Events such as loss of pet or hobby, serious illness of a partner, death of spouse, financial troubles were found to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and multiple events had a cumulative effect (Chan et al.,
2012; Chou & Chi, 2000).

Although the impact of life events may be timelimited (Norris & Murrell, 1987), depressive symptoms triggered by SLEs have a long-lasting impact by in turn predicting later life events, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle of depression and SLEs (Fiske et al. 2003). Late-life depression is a risk factor for a number of negative outcomes including ill health (Beekman, Kriegman, Deeg, &
van Tilburg, 1995), poorer illness recovery (Morris, Raphael, & Robinson, 1992), cognitive decline (Yaffe et al., 1999) and an increase in the cost of medical services (Un€utzer et al., 1997). For these reasons, research into protective factors against late-life depression is therefore important.

Late-life well-being research has found that psychosocial resources such as personal control (Ensel, 1991),
sense of mastery (Jeon & Dunkle, 2009) and sense of purpose in life (Chow & Ho, 2012) can act as protective factors against late-life depression arising from SLEs. Many studies have looked at the effects of psychosocial resources singly or independently (e.g. Chou & Chi, 2001).

However, it is more likely that it is the combination of psychological and social factors that renders the protection against late-life depression arising from SLEs. Few studies have investigated the protective effects of a combined, broader spectrum of psychosocial resources, which have been broadly conceived in recent times as
'resilience'.

Resilience has been variously defined as an outcome, a set of personality traits or a process. Consensus on its definition and conceptualization has yet been reached. Based on an extensive review of literature and concept analysis, Windle (2011) has defined resilience as the 'process of negotiating, managing and adapting to significant sources of stress or trauma'. Conceptualized as a process, resilience can be seen as being influenced by protective factors individual qualities, social and environmental resources.

Resilience in older adults has been the subject of many recent studies and many have found that resilience was related to better self-rated health, emotional and psychological well-being, cognitive and physical functioning, selfrated successful ageing, life satisfaction as well as longevity (Caltabiano & Caltabiano, 2006; de Paula Couto, Koller, & Novo, 2011; Hardy, Concato, & Gill, 2004; Lamond et al., 2008; Nygren et al., 2005; Wagnild, 2003; Wagnild & Young, 1993; Wells, 2010; Zeng & Shen, 2010).

Although resilience has been shown to be associated with lower levels of depressive symptomatology among older adults (Hardy et al., 2004; Schure, Odden, & Goins, 2013; Wagnild & Young, 1993), there is a paucity of data showing significant interaction effects of resilience and SLE, thus demonstrating the moderating role of resilience in the relationship between SLEs and depression in late life. It has been argued that interaction effects are the
'defining feature' of the resilience construct, without which, it is questionable whether resilience adds to the study of human development (Roosa, 2000).

Two studies that investigated the buffering effects of resilience against the impact of SLEs on measures of psychological well-being did not find significant results of interactions between resilience and SLEs (Caltabiano &
Caltabiano, 2006; de Paula Couto et al., 2011). A small number of studies of older Chinese adults found that resilience factors helped older Chinese adults cope with loneliness (Lou & Ng, 2012) and is related to longevity (Zeng &
Shen, 2010) but to our knowledge, the effect of resilience in moderating the impact of SLEs on depressive symptomatology in older Chinese adults has not been demonstrated. As different culture and beliefs often mean that individuals draw upon different internal and external resources to help deal with adversities (Ungar, 2010), the underlying dimensions of resilience among older Chinese adults may not be similar to those from other populations.

This has yet to be investigated as well.

In summary, depressive symptoms have been found to be highly prevalent in older populations and SLEs have been consistently linked with higher depressive symptomatology in this group. Despite the documented protective role of resilience against late-life depression, research into its moderating role in the link between SLEs and depression remains largely unexamined. This relationship has yet been investigated among Chinese older adults as well.

It is important for evidence-based mental health policy and programme planning that there should be convincing empirical data of interactive effects supporting the role of resilience as a buffer against the adverse impact of recent SLEs in terms of depressive symptomatology. It is also important to demarcate the key underlying components of resilience that should be targeted for intervention. The objectives of this study are thus to investigate the impact of SLEs on depressive symptomatology and the role of resilience and its underlying dimensions in moderating the relationship between SLEs and depressive symptomatology in older Chinese adults.

## Method Study Participants

This study was conducted on a cohort subsample of 500 consecutive participants aged 60 and above in the second wave recruitment of the Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Studies (SLAS-2), an on-going population-based study of ageing and health of community-dwelling older adults aged 55 and above living in local geographically defined areas in the Central and SouthWestern regions of Singapore and has been detailed elsewhere (Lim, Collinson, Feng, & Ng, 2010). This study involved 385 Chinese participants for whom complete data on health, lifestyle and psychosocial variables including occurrence of recent adverse life events, resilience and their subjective wellbeing were available for analyses.

## Procedure

Participants were recruited by research nurses through door-to-door visits of all dwelling units in one locale
(Bukit Merah; response rate D 78.5%). Participants were advised that the study was to investigate the factors relating to well-being in older adults before providing informed consent. Trained research nurses administered all scales and questionnaires used in the study via face-toface interviews in a language the participant spoke and understood (English or Chinese) at a research site (e.g.

senior activity centre) closest to the participant's residence. The study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board.

## Measures

Stressful life events (SLEs)
Self report of SLEs was measured by an 11-item life events inventory used in the Women's Health Initiative observational study (Michael et al., 2009; Ruberman, Weinblatt, Goldberg, & Chaudhary, 1984). The participants were asked to indicate yes or no as to whether any of 11 life events had occurred over the past year: 'spouse or partner died, a family member or close friend died or have a serious illness (other than your spouse or partner),
major problems with money, a divorce or breakup, family member or close friend have a divorce or breakup, major conflict with children or grandchildren, major accidents, disasters, muggings, unwanted sexual experiences, robberies, or similar events, a family member or close friend lose their job or retire, physically abused, verbally abused, or pet died'. The occurrence of 'at least one visit to the emergency room and/or hospitalization in the past year' was added to this list.

## Depressive Symptomatology

The presence of depressive symptoms was assessed using the 15-item The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)
(Yesavage et al., 1982). Participants were asked to respond yes (1) or no (0) to each of 15 items that describe how they felt over the past week. Summation of item scores was used to determine the levels of depressive symptomatology, with higher scores denoting greater number of depressive symptoms present. GDS-15 has been found to be a valid and reliable screening tool for depression from validation studies in the local older population. (Nyunt, Fones, Niti, & Ng, 2009). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.80 and a score of 5 and above has been shown to denote the presence of a clinically significant level of depressed mood (Nyunt, Lim, Yap, & Ng, 2012).

## Resilience

Resilience was measured using the ConnorDavidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), (Connor & Davidson, 2003), comprising 25 items, each rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'not true at all' (0) to 'true nearly all the time' (4). The summed scores from the 25 items were used to measure resilience on a continuum, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of resilience. The Cronbach's alpha for this study was 0.86.

## Socio-Demographic Variables

The effect estimate of SLEs on depressive symptomatology was adjusted for socio-demographic variables known to be associated with late-life well-being: they included age (in years), gender (0 D female, 1 D male), marital status (0 D others: never married/separated/divorced/widowed, 1 D married) and education (in years)
(McLaughlin, Connell, Heeringa, Li, & Roberts, 2010 ).

## Statistical Analyses

Analysis of variance for continuous variables (education, GDS and resilience scores) and Chi-square tests of significance for dichotomous variables (gender, marital status, and depressive status) were performed to explore differences in socio-demographic variables across participants grouped by age [youngold (aged 6069) and oldold (aged 70 and above)]. Descriptive analyses were run to illustrate the prevalence of individual SLE in the whole sample and across the age groups.

In order to explore the unique underlying pattern of resilience among older Chinese adults and further examine the relationships between underlying dimensions of resilience, SLEs and depressive symptomatology, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed on the scores of the CD-RISC. Different models with 3-, 4-,
and 5-factor solutions were tried in turn. Cronbach's alphas for the scale and each factor were then computed.

Multiple regression analyses were performed to explore the associations between the number of SLEs, resilience and depressive symptomatology. Predictor variables entered into the regression model included age, education, gender, marital status, resilience and the number of SLEs; the dependent variable was the GDS score. The moderating effect of resilience was tested by adding an interaction term (resilience £ number of SLEs) into the model. Both variables were centred to reduce multicolinearity due to the interaction term. This analysis was repeated for each resilience factor and for each age group.

To produce the figures to illustrate the relationships between the variables, resilience was categorized into
'low' and 'moderate to high' levels using a 20th percentile cut-off based on previous approaches (e.g. Arce et al.,
2009; Bonanno et al., 2002). This approach is to commensurate with the practical assumption that the majority of older adults are able to successfully cope with the stressors of late life, and a minority with low levels of resilience are vulnerable to developing adverse outcomes. The number of SLEs was grouped into three categories: no SLEs, 1 SLE and more than 1 SLE.

## Results Sample Characteristics

Table 1 shows the sample characteristics. The mean age of the participants in this study was 72.1 years (SD D 5.8),
58.2% were female and 56.1% were married. Participants had an average of 4.1 (SD D 3.9) years of education.

Those who were younger (youngold D aged 6069)
had more years of education (p < 0.0001) than the oldold (aged 70 and above) and more likely to be married
(p D 0.041).

The mean GDS score was 1.1 (SD D 1.98) and 4.4% of the sample had a GDS score of 5 and above. The oldold had significantly more depressive symptoms that those who were younger (p D 0.004), and were more likely than the youngold to have a GDS score of 5 and above (p D
0.001). The mean resilience score was 84.9 (SD D 11.19).

There was no significant difference in resilience scores between the oldold and the youngold (p D 0.065).

## Prevalence Of Stressful Life Events

As shown in Table 2, 45.2% of the participants reported at least one SLE in the year prior to the interview. The most

frequently reported event was death or serious illness of a family member or a close friend (17.1%), followed by major financial problems (14.0%) and hospitalization or visit to the emergency room for medical illness (9.9%).

The frequency distribution was: no event (54.8%), 1 event
(26.2%), 2 events (11.7%), 3 events (4.2%), 4 events
(2.1%), 5 events (0.8%) and 6 events (0.3%).

The oldold were also more likely than the young old to report experiencing at least one SLE in the year prior to the interview (p D 0.011), particularly that their spouse/partner died (p D 0.007), that a family member/ close friend had lost jobs or retired (p D 0.018) or they had been physically abused (p D 0.046).

## Resilience Factor Structure

The 5- and 4-factor solutions were rejected due to multiple cross-loadings and non-meaningful factors. The 3-factor structure solution was chosen for its interpretability (Table 3). This model explained 43.1% of the variance.

The factors that emerged were: (1) personal competence and optimism (10 items; Cronbach's alpha D 0.837);
(2) commitment and perseverance (7 items; Cronbach's alpha D 0.791); (3) independence and self-esteem (8 items; Cronbach's alpha D 0.661) was obtained and the Cronbach's alpha for scale was 0.864. KaiserMeyer Olkin measure of sampling adequacy index was 0.92 and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (x2 D 3043.09, df D 300, p < .001).

## Resilience, Number Of Stressful Life Events And Depressive Symptomatology For The Whole Sample

Controlling for age, gender and other co-variables, a greater number of SLEs was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001) and a higher level of resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001). (Table 4) The interaction term between resilience and the number of SLEs was significant (p D 0.003), indicating that resilience moderates the impact of SLEs on depressive symptomatology. The negative sign indicates that the impact of SLEs on depressive symptomatology was

However, only factor 1 (personal competence and optimism) showed a significant interaction with SLE indicating a buffering effect against the impact of SLEs (p <

## Discussion

The finding of main effects of SLEs and resilience on the level of depressive symptomatology are expected and unsurprising. They are consistent with previous reports of associations between SLEs and increased depressive symptomatology, (Chan et al., 2012; Colenda & Smith, 1993) and resilience with lower levels of depressive symptomatology among older adults (Hardy et al., 2004; Schure et al., 2013).

To our knowledge, this study provides for the first time convincing empirical data supporting the role of

resilience as a buffer against the adverse impact of recent stressful events in terms of depressive symptomatology. This was accomplished by showing a strong interaction effect of resilience and SLEs, given its main effect in lowering the levels of depressive symptomatology. The adverse impact of SLEs in terms of depressive symptomatology was evidently lesser among those with higher levels of resilience than among those with low resilience.

Previous studies for methodological reasons have failed to find significant interaction effects between SLEs and resilience (Caltabiano & Caltabiano, 2006; de Paula Couto et al., 2011). These studies had smaller sample sizes and examined other measures of subjective or psychological well-being as outcome variables and not depressive symptomatology per se.

We also explored in this study the underlying dimensions of resilience among old Chinese adults. Factor analysis of the CD-RISC in the original validation study of American adults resulted in five factors: (1) personal competence, high standards and tenacity; (2) trust in one's instincts, tolerance of negative affect and strengthening effects of stress; (3) positive acceptance of change and secure relationships; (4) control; and (5) spiritual influences. The Chinese version of the CD-RISC used in a general population sample in China (Yu & Zhang, 2007) was found to be unable to retain the original 5-factor structure obtained in the USA. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 3-factor structure explaining 45.0% of the variance: (1) tenacity, (2) strength and (3). Our factor analysis of the CD-RISC yielded three underlying dimensions reflecting (1) a sense of personal competence and optimism, (2)
commitment and perseverance and (3) independence and self-esteem. The internal consistency of the scale was high but the underlying structure was dissimilar to both the original five factors and the three factors that emerged from Yu and Zhang's (2007) study on the Chinese population in China.

In our resulting structure, factor 1 (personal competence and optimism) explained a large proportion of the variance in the CD-RISC scores and extracted all the items from the original factor 3 (positive acceptance of change and secure relationship) plus one or two items each from other factors. It also comprised nearly half of the items in factor 1 (tenacity) in the Chinese study (Yu &
Zhang, 2007). The items that loaded onto factors 2 and 3 are a mixture of items from different factors both in the original as well as the Chinese structure. These results suggest that while the construct of resilience may be universal and the scale is applicable in other populations, the pattern of resilience is highly context-dependent. Indeed, although our study sample consisted of ethnic Chinese adults, the pattern of resilience that emerged is markedly different from that obtained from the Chinese study in China. This is not surprising as Chinese minorities in Southeast Asia as a group has been regarded being dissimilar in identities and orientation from Chinese nationals
(e.g. Hirschman, 1988). In our study sample, a sense of confidence in handling stressors and hope are key individual qualities underlying resilience.

When we analysed the moderating effect of each underlying resilience factor, we found that only factor 1 appeared to be the significant buffer against the impact of SLEs for both the youngold and oldold. Factor 1 can be viewed as incorporating important psychosocial resources for dealing with SLEs such as death or serious illness of family member or close friend or major financial problems. Indeed, the components of factor 1 are closely related to sense of personal control and mastery, which have been independently found to be protective factors against late-life depression (Chou & Chi, 2001; Ensel, 1991; Jeon & Dunkle, 2009).

Factors 2 and 3 were not found to significantly moderate the link between SLEs and depressive symptomatology in this study. This may be because factor 2 reflects resilience resources such as commitment or perseverance which would presumably be more pertinent in dealing with chronic stress, which is not measured by the SLE
inventory of single occurrences of acute stress events. It will be interesting to investigate if this underlying dimension of resilience plays a role in buffering against the impact of chronic life stressors. Factor 3 reflects a sense of independence and having high self-esteem which might not be applicable in the context of acute stressors which are largely non-egocentric.

Our study findings have practical importance and relevance for mental health programmes for older adults.

Delineating the buffering effect of specific underlying resilience domain(s) is essential for formulating targeted interventions and programmes. Personal competence and optimism has emerged as a key psychological resource in protecting against the risk of developing depression arising from SLEs. Interventions that aim at enhancing older adults' sense of personal control and mastery therefore may have beneficial effects in reducing depressive symptomatology relating to SLEs in later life. Indeed, a large body of evidence suggests that perceived control and sense of mastery may be enhanced via psycho-educational interventions, cognitive therapies and behavioural activation methods. Recent evidence suggests that such an intervention programme resulted in improvement in depressive symptoms among middle- and older-aged adults (Zautra et al., 2012).

There are secondary findings in this study that are worth noting. Oldold participants reported experiencing a greater number of recent SLEs than the youngold, particularly from loss of a spouse, family member/close friend lost job or retire, major conflict with children/
grandchildren and physical abuse. At the same time, they also reported more depressive symptoms than the youngold, consistent with previous findings (Jeon & Dunkle, 2009; Kessler et al., 1992). Death or illness of a family member or friend is regarded as most stressful by older adults (Hardy, Concato, & Gill, 2002), and indeed, events relating to 'loss' have been found to more likely predict depressive symptomatology in late life (Chan et al., 2012; Chou & Chi, 2000; De Beurs et al., 2001).

This study has a number of limitations that should be noted. First, the life events inventory is not exhaustive and this limits deeper exploration in this study. Thus, the link between resilience and depressive symptomatology in the context of minor but chronic stressors such as daily hassles or chronic strain such as from care-giving were not explored in this study. As it is likely that chronic strains and life events may interact in a variety of ways, examining both life events and chronic strains together should be helpful in better understanding the protective role of resilience in late life. Another limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design. This may present problems of the retrospective evaluation of life events and recall bias, as well as the difficulty in drawing firm causal inferences from the contemporaneous measurements of study variables. Further studies using longitudinal data are required.

Also, the study sample cannot be considered representative, thus the generalizability of these results is unknown.

Despite these limitations, this study indicates that interventions aimed at building resilience in the older adult population may have expected benefits in terms of reduced depressive symptomatology in later life. Future studies should investigate the underlying mechanisms, processes and possible interventions by which older adults may be conferred protection against the adverse effects of life events and stress.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our analyses support previous findings on the link between SLEs and depressive symptomatology as well as higher levels of resilience and lower levels of symptomatology. In addition, our study findings reaffirmed that the pattern of resilience is highly contextdependent. The factor structure that emerged from our factor analysis is markedly different from that obtained from previous studies on different populations. In our study, a sense of personal competence and optimism has emerged as a key underlying dimension of resilience that moderated the adverse effects of SLEs on depressive symptomatology. Future studies should further explore the protective effect of these resources against minor, chronic stressors and examine the underlying mechanisms of resilience by using longitudinal design on a more representative sample.
