Perceived stress Problematic SNS usage Psychological resilience College students This study was aimed to test the association between perceived stress and problematic social networking site
(SNS) usage, and to figure out whether psychological resilience moderated this relationship. The Perceived Stress Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire were administered to 499 Chinese college students. The results showed that (1) perceived stress was positively associated with problematic SNS usage; (2) psychological resilience was negatively related with problematic SNS usage; and (3) psychological resilience moderated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage. Specifically, the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage was statistically significant for students with a lower level of psychological resilience, while no significant association was found for those with a higher level of psychological resilience. The findings emphasize the importance of enhancing psychological resilience to decrease the likelihood of college students who experience higher level of stress from using SNS problematically.

## 1. Introduction

The use of social networking sites (SNSs), which refers to the online services that aim to build social relations among people who share interests and activities (Huang, Hsieh, & Wu, 2014), has rapidly become a global consumer phenomenon. Several popular SNSs, such as Facebook, SnapChat, Twitter, and Weibo in China (in particular, Sina Weibo) are widely used among teenagers and young adults, as they provide an open platform for these individuals to produce and exchange information such as personal pictures, videos, interests and preferences
(Milošević-Đorđević & Žeželj, 2014). Some studies have demonstrated that appropriate SNS use can be beneficial to individuals' mental health, such as reducing loneliness (Amichai-Hamburger & Ben-Artzi, 2003), enhancing self-esteem (Gonzales & Hancock, 2011), and improving life satisfaction (Zhan, Sun, Wang, & Zhang, 2016). However, excessive use of SNS may be detrimental to individuals' mental health, including undermining users' subjective happiness (Uysal, Satici, & Akin, 2013) which may lead to depression (Giota & Kleftaras, 2013), loneliness (Ndasauka et al., 2016), and sometimes even symptoms of behavioral addiction (Barbera, Paglia, & Valsavoia, 2009).

With the rapid and wide adoption of SNS, problematic SNS usage has recently attracted significant attention from researchers and mental

health practitioners and has been proposed as a new type of behavioral addiction (Andreassen & Pallesen, 2014). SNS addiction is defined as
"being overly concerned about SNSs, driven by a strong motivation to log on to or use SNSs, and to devote so much time and effort to SNSs that it impairs other social activities, studies/job, interpersonal relationships, and/or psychological health and well-being" (Andreassen &
Pallesen, 2014, p. 4054). However, due to disagreement in terms of the definition or diagnostic criteria of SNS addiction (Ryan, Chester, Reece, & Xenos, 2014), in the current study we use a more conservative term: "problematic SNS usage". Problematic SNS usage implies that the SNS may be used in a way that leads to problematic outcomes, but does not necessarily result in clinical symptoms analogous to addiction. In their study, Huang et al. (2014) defined problematic SNS usage as (a)
maladaptive preoccupation with SNS use, experienced as irresistible use for periods of time longer than intended and (b) distress or impairment resulting from such behavior.

Prior studies have shown that problematic SNS usage is negatively associated with subjective happiness (Uysal et al., 2013), academic performance (Glass, Li, & Pan, 2014) and social interaction in real life
(Ndasauka et al., 2016). However, problematic SNS usage is positively related to relationship dissatisfaction (Elphinston & Noller, 2011), depression (Giota & Kleftaras, 2013) and loneliness (Ndasauka et al.,
2016). However, existing research has mostly focused on the negative outcomes of problematic SNS usage, while little knowledge has been obtained on the risk and protective factors for the development of problematic SNS usage (Wu, Cheung, Ku, & Hung, 2013). Problematic SNS usage is similar to other excessive Internet-related activities, including smartphone addiction, online gaming addiction and cyber addiction (Samaha & Hawi, 2016; Snodgrass et al., 2014; Tavolacci et al.,
2013). However, problematic SNS usage can be different from excessive use of other internet-related activities because SNS is mainly used for online social interaction (Milošević-Đorđević & Žeželj, 2014).

In sum, few studies have examined which risk factors may lead to problematic SNS usage and whether there are protective factors that may buffer the influence of risk factors on problematic SNS usage.

Thus, the present study aims to simultaneously investigate the role of a risk factor (perceived stress) and a protective factor (psychological resilience) in influencing problematic SNS usage among Chinese college students. Specifically, we investigate the effect of perceived stress on problematic SNS usage and whether the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage is moderated by psychological resilience. We next explain why we chose perceived stress and psychological resilience as we review relevant literature and theorize about their effects.

## 1.1. Perceived Stress And Problematic Sns Usage

Entering college is viewed as a major life transition for most young adults (Aseltine, Gore, & Colten, 1994) and can be a stressful life experience. With rapid psychological, biological and social changes, college students face challenges from within, as well as from school, peers, and family (Yan, Li, & Sui, 2014), which may elicit relatively high levels of perceived stress. Perceived stress is defined as a situation that individuals evaluate as threatening or otherwise demanding and that they lack sufficient resources to address (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Perceived stress has been regarded as a risk factor in the onset and relapse of many addiction disorders (Sinha, 2008) such as alcohol misuse, eating disorders, cyber addiction (Tavolacci et al., 2013), and smartphone addiction (Samaha & Hawi, 2016). Perceived stress can provoke interacting somatic and psychological states, which engender stress responsiveness and render individuals more vulnerable to addicting behaviors, including excessive Internet use (Hawkins, Catalano, & Miller, 1992; Rhodes & Jason, 1990).

The positive association between perceived stress and addictive or problematic Internet-related activities has been reported in several studies (e.g., Snodgrass et al., 2014; Velezmoro, Lacefield, & Roberti, 2010; Yan et al., 2014). For example, in a nationally representative sample of 74,980 Korean adolescents, Yoo, Cho, and Cha (2014) found that potential Internet addiction prevalence was higher in both boys and girls who reported moderate or higher subjective stress. Similarly, when investigating the association of stressful life events and psychological symptoms with Internet addiction, Tang et al. (2014) reported that stressors stemming from interpersonal and school related problems and anxiety symptoms were linked to Internet addiction after accounting for demographic characteristics. Thus, we hypothesize that perceived stress is positively related to problematic SNS usage among Chinese college students (hypothesis 1).

## 1.2. Psychological Resilience And Problematic Sns Usage

In addition to reporting perceived stress as a risk factor for problematic behaviors (e.g., Tavolacci et al., 2013; Samaha & Hawi, 2016), there is evidence suggesting that individuals' psychological resilience might play an important role in preventing the emergence of problematic behaviors. Psychological resilience refers to a personal trait that inoculates individuals against the impact of adversity or traumatic events (Connor & Davidson, 2003; Ong, Bergeman, Bisconti, & Wallace, 2006); it is often considered to be negatively related to individuals' internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors (Lee & Cranford, 2008). For example, numerous studies have found that psychological resilience is inversely related to internalizing problems, including depression (Lukow et al.,
2015), anxiety (Abiola & Udofia, 2011), job burnout symptoms (Tian et al., 2015), severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (Asnaani, Alpert, McLean, & Foa, 2015), and psychopathology (Sexton, Hamilton, McGinnis, Rosenblum, & Muzik, 2015).

Additionally, individuals with higher psychological resilience levels are also less likely to develop problematic externalizing behaviors. For instance, cross-sectional studies (Alvarez-Aguirre, Alonso-Castillo, &
Zanetti, 2014; Bartone, Hystad, Eid, & Brevik, 2012; Dinsmore, Johnson, & Hof, 2011) as well as a longitudinal study (Green, Beckham, Youssef, & Elbogen, 2014) have shown that psychological resilience may prevent the development of alcohol misuse. Moreover, individuals' substance use (Weiland et al., 2012) and frequent smoking
(Goldstein, Faulkner, & Wekerle, 2013) can be reduced through increasing their psychological resilience. Its protective role in decreasing problematic behaviors has also been reported in the fields of gambling
(Lussier, Derevensky, Gupta, Bergevin, & Ellenbogen, 2007) and eating disorders (Las Hayas et al., 2014). Considering that psychological resilience has been found to be negatively related to problem behaviors, we hypothesize that psychological resilience is negatively related to problematic SNS usage (hypothesis 2).

1.3. Psychological resilience as a moderator variable College students may display psychological distress or problematic behaviors when exposed to stressful situations, such as high stakes academic tests, interpersonal relations, relationship problems, life changes, and career exploration (Kai-Wen, 2010). However, it has been suggested that the impact stressful life events have on mental health may be contingent upon an individual's own characteristics, such as psychological resilience (Li, Zhang, Li, Zhen, & Wang, 2010). Psychological resilience can help individuals cope with adversity, adequately adjust, and aid development (Hu, Zhang, & Wang, 2015). It provides individuals with the necessary ability to respond effectively under stress and protect their mental health (Connor & Davidson, 2003; Dyrbye et al.,
2010). Following this line of argument, psychological resilience may prevent stressed individuals from forming problematic SNS usage behaviors. In addition, prior studies have found that psychological resilience can buffer the impact of stress or adversity risks on problem behaviors. For instance, in a recent study of 2024 inner-city U.S. adults, Wingo, Ressler, and Bradley (2014) found that the trait of resilience can buffer the negative influence of individuals' childhood abuse on their lifetime alcohol use and illicit drug use, after controlling for trauma severity, age, and sex. Several studies have also found that individuals with high levels of resilience are less affected by stress or adversity risks and consequently are less susceptible to problem behaviors (Lee & Cranford, 2008; Roy, Carli, & Sarchiapone, 2011; Stoddard, Zimmerman, & Bauermeister, 2012). Due to the common underlying etiological framework that problematic SNS use shares with other problem behaviors (Kuss & Griffiths, 2011), we assume that psychological resilience will buffer the impact of perceived stress on problematic SNS usage.

Considering the empirical evidence that psychological resilience can serve as a protective factor mitigating the association between stress or adversity and problematic behaviors, we hypothesize that psychological resilience moderates (dampens) the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage (hypothesis 3). Specifically, we expect that the positive association between perceived stress and problematic SNS
usage will be weaker for users with high level of psychological resilience, compared to those with low psychological resilience.

## 2. Methods

2.1. Sample Participants were 499 college students (mean age = 19.90, SD =
1.35) from two universities in Chongqing, China. Among them, 385
(77.6%) were females. The sample consisted of 46.8% freshmen, 37.7%
sophomores, 9.9% juniors, and 5.6% seniors. About half (55.6%) of the participants majored in natural science (math, physics, chemistry, biology, life sciences, and computer sciences) and 44.4% in social science
(economics, business administration, education, philology, law, politics, and philosophy). The survey was carried out between April and May 2015. The participants were informed that their involvement was voluntary and that their responses would be anonymous. They were given approximately 20 min to complete the questionnaires and were given a notebook for their participation. All reported having an active Weibo user account. The word Weibo means "micro-blog" in Chinese, a Twitter-like microblogging service site which started in 2009. We chose Sina Weibo as our study SNS because it is one of the most popular SNSs in China. Sina Weibo provides users with an effective way for seeking information and social communication (e.g. sharing images, videos, reading news and making friends).

## 2.2. Measures 2.2.1. Perceived Stress Scale (Pss)

The stress and level of control that participants perceived over the past month were measured with a 14-item questionnaire developed by Cohen et al. (1983). For each item, participants reported whether a special event had occurred during the past month. If yes, they then indicated how stressful and their perceived lack of control for this event on a 5-point scale. Higher scores represent higher stress levels and a higher perceived lack of control (sample items: "In the last month, how often have you dealt successfully with irritating life hassles?"; "In the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?").

Cronbach's α for the construct was 0.69. Following the instructions from the originating authors of the PSS (Cohen et al., 1983), we summed all 14 items to create an aggregated score for PSS.

## 2.2.2. Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (Cd-Risc)

The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC, Connor &
Davidson, 2003) was used to measure psychological resilience. The scale consists of 25 items, such as "able to adapt to change," "tend to bounce back after illness or hardship," and "have a strong sense of purpose," each of which was rated by respondents on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = "not true at all" to 5 = "true nearly all of the time".

Participants responded to each item according to their experiences during the previous month. The total score was achieved by summing all responses, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The Chinese version of the CD-RISC has demonstrated good reliability (Yu
& Zhang, 2007). The internal consistency for construct was α = 0.86.

## 2.2.3. Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire (Fiq)

In order to measure problematic SNS usage, a modified version of the Facebook Intrusion Questionnaire (FIQ, Elphinston & Noller, 2011) was used. The translation and back-translation procedure was used to establish a Chinese version. Additionally, items were revised to fit the Weibo usage (sample items: "I often think about Weibo when I am not using it" and "I often use Weibo for no particular reason"). Specifically, according to our interviews with Chinese college students (who were not members of the sample under study), we added two items to the original eight-item scale ("I often hide the time of using Weibo from my family and friends"; "I often use Weibo while doing other things, such as eating, attending class, etc."). For each of the 10 items, participants indicated how true each statement was on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 =
"not at all true" to 5 = "very true". The final score was obtained by summing up the scores of all items, with a higher score representing a greater level of problematic SNS usage. The internal consistency for the construct was α = 0.77.

## 2.3. Statistical Analyses

The statistical package SPSS 18.0 was used for our data analyses.

Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the strengths of linear relationships among all variables. We ran a t-test to examine the overall difference in problematic SNS usage between individuals with high and low levels of psychological resilience. Based on Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003), we used a hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test the moderating effect. The predictor variable (perceived stress) and moderator variable (psychological resilience) were mean-centered to reduce multicollinearity issues, prior to the computation of the interaction term of perceived stress × psychological resilience. We followed the recommendations of Cohen et al. (2003) for interpreting the interaction between the predictor variable and the moderator variable. Specifically, the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage was plotted when the levels of the psychological resilience were one standard deviation below and above the mean value of psychological resilience. We also tested the statistical significance (alpha = 0.01) of each of the two slopes (Aiken & West, 1991), which represented the simple effect of the predictor variable on problematic SNS usage at the two levels of psychological resilience. In addition, since previous studies have demonstrated that gender (Çam & Isbulan, 2012; Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, & Zickuhr, 2010) and age (Andreassen, Torsheim, Brunborg, & Pallesen, 2012; Turel & Serenko, 2012) may have an impact on the development of problematic SNS usage, gender and age were added as control variables in our model.

## 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Analyses

Means, standard deviations, and correlations among the study variables are presented in Table 1. Perceived stress was significantly correlated with psychological resilience and problematic SNS usage
(p b 0.01). Regarding H1, perceived stress has a statistically significant positive correlation with problematic SNS usage (H1 supported). Moreover, regarding H2, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between psychological resilience and problematic SNS usage (H2 supported).

## 3.2. Moderating Effect Analyses

The results regarding the moderating effect of psychological resilience on the association between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage (H3) are displayed in Table 2. It shows that gender, perceived stress, and the interaction term of perceived stress and psychological resilience are significantly related to problematic SNS usage, with β =
0.16 (p b 0.01), β = −0.21 (p b 0.01) and β = −0.20 (p b 0.001), respectively. To facilitate the interpretation of the interaction effect, we conducted a simple slope test (Aiken & West, 1991), which revealed problematic SNS usage as a function of perceived stress and psychological resilience (see Fig. 1). The positive relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage is statistically significant among respondents with lower levels of psychological resilience (β = 0.37, p b 0.001), but not for those with higher levels of psychological resilience (β = 0.09, p N 0.05; H3 supported). Regarding the control

variables, gender has a significant effect on problematic SNS usage, while age does not. Specifically, females are more likely to report problematic behaviors than males. Meanwhile, there is a significant difference in problematic SNS usage between individuals with high levels of psychological resilience and those with low levels of psychological resilience (t = 2.21, p b 0.05).

## 4. Discussion

The aim of this study is to understand whether perceived stress and psychological resilience can predict problematic SNS usage. We found that perceived stress is significantly and positively associated with problematic SNS usage, which supports our first hypothesis and is consistent with previous findings (e.g., Tang et al., 2014; Velezmoro et al.,
2010; Yoo et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2014). Our findings suggest that Chinese college students who have high levels of perceived stress are more susceptible to problematic SNS usage compared to students with low levels of perceived stress. This finding supports the prevalent view that stress is a risk factor in the onset and relapse of addiction disorders among college students (Sinha, 2008). A possible explanation is that college students may use the SNS as a means of stress relief or as a stress coping strategy to escape from reality and compensate for unsatisfactory social interactions when confronted with excessive life stress (Leung, 2007; Yan et al., 2014). SNS usage could be used to satisfy users' need for psychological escape when individuals are confronted with real-life problems or challenging situations (Young & de Abreu, 2010). This hypothesis has been corroborated in a study by Snodgrass et al. (2014), which indicated that highly stressed online gamers may use online gaming (problematically) as a way to relieve their preexisting life stress, which might further magnify their stress experience. Moreover, this study is among the first attempts to examine the relationship between psychological resilience and problematic SNS usage.

As expected, psychological resilience was found to be negatively related to problematic SNS usage, although it should be noted that the correlation is at a modest level (r = 0.18). This finding supports our second

usage.
hypothesis and is in accordance with prior studies (for reviews, see Alvarez-Aguirre et al., 2014; Goldstein et al., 2013; Lussier et al., 2007; Weiland et al., 2012), all of which demonstrate that psychological resilience can prevent the development of problem behaviors. A possible explanation for this association is that individuals with high resilience might possess specific characteristics, such as a sound perspective on reality, a strong capacity for self-reflection, a responsible nature, and a high tolerance for negative feelings (Vanderpol, 2002). All of these characteristics enable individuals with high psychological resilience to be more proactive in challenging situations and better able to cope with these situations by using both internal and external resources (Alvord
& Grados, 2005). Therefore, resilient people may be more likely to engage in positive behaviors and activities that promote health-enhancing social resources and healthy lifestyles as well as to process information and utilize available resources (Yang & Wen, 2015). In such cases, they are better able to combat stressful situations and less likely to develop negative behaviors and activities (e.g. problematic SNS usage).

Furthermore, supporting our hypothesis 3, we found that psychological resilience moderates the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage. Specifically, the simple slope test indicates that the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage is statistically significant for students who reported low level of psychological resilience, but not significant for students who reported high level of psychological resilience. This finding is consistent with other literature, which has identified the protective role of psychological resilience in decreasing problematic behaviors when individuals faced stress or adversity risks (Lee & Cranford, 2008; Roy et al., 2011; Stoddard et al., 2012; Wingo et al., 2014). It has been suggested that resilient individuals may have more positive perceptions of, and more intrinsic resources to effectively deal with, unfavorable situations, and are thus less likely be lost in the virtual realm of the Internet (Kim, Choi, &
Kim, 2007). Moreover, our finding supports the protective factor model by Garmezy, Masten, and Tellegen (1984), which holds that the negative influence of stress on adaptive behaviors can be reduced when certain positive personal attributes are present. Psychological resilience seems to be a protective factor which could guard against problematic SNS usage when individuals are confronted with perceived stress.

Our study has some limitations. First, convenience sampling was used in this study, falling short of representing the diverse population of SNS users in China. Therefore, the generalization of the results to other populations or groups should be cautioned. However, our sample represents the largest SNS user group (young adults in China). Second, the present study is cross-sectional. Therefore, definitive claims about causality cannot be made. In the future, it will be a worthwhile endeavor to establish causal links between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage by conducting longitudinal or experimental designs. Third, the variance explained in the dependent variable is only about 13%. Perhaps this is understandable given we only have two antecedents and an interaction. Finally, we only examine one type of SNS (i.e., Weibo); other SNS platforms should be considered. It is plausible that some individuals use multiple SNSs and the inclusion of other possible SNSs may deepen our understanding on problematic SNS usage.

Despite these limitations, this study has advanced previous research by highlighting the protective effect of psychological resilience on the relationship between perceived stress and problematic SNS usage in a Chinese college student sample. We found that perceived stress may lead to problematic SNS usage and that psychological resilience can mitigate the negative impact of perceived stress on problematic SNS usage.

These findings suggest that enhancing psychological resilience may be an effective intervention for preventing or decreasing problematic SNS
usage for students who face high levels of perceived stress. Many studies (e.g. Hodder et al., 2011; Sood, Prasad, Schroeder, & Varkey, 2011; Steinhardt & Dolbier, 2008) have suggested effective interventions for enhancing psychological resilience, and thus offer hope for practical applications of our findings.
