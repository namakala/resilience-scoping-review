Objective: Adolescence and young adulthood are developmental periods during the life course that are sometimes associated with heightened stress and engagement in binge eating. Binge eating has been linked to psychiatric comorbidity, poorer physical health, and lower quality of life. However, less is known about protective factors that could buffer against binge eating behaviors. The current study examined the moderating role of resilience on the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms among emerging adult female college students.

Method: Participants were 297 young adult women aged 18–25 years (Mage = 19.22, SD = 1.51; 52% selfidentifying as a racial/ethnic minority) with Body Mass Index ranging from 15 to 66 (MBMI = 25.01, SD = 6.18).

Women completed this cross-sectional study while they were attending universities in the Western or Southern United States. Participants provided demographic and height/weight information, and completed the following measures: Perceived Stress Scale, Binge Eating Scale, and Brief Resilience Scale.

Results: Higher perceived stress was significantly associated with more severe binge eating symptoms (b = 0.31; p < .01). In addition, higher resilience was associated with lower binge eating pathology (b = −0.20; p < .01). Moderation was supported as the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms varied by resilience level (b = −0.16; p < .01).

Conclusions: Women who perceived higher stress were more likely to engage in binge eating relative to women experiencing low stress; however, resilience attenuated this association. Resilience could be targeted to reduce the negative effects of perceived stress on eating behaviors in young women.

## 1. Introduction

Binge eating is a diagnostic marker implicated in all three eating disorders (i.e., Binge Eating Disorder (BED), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and Anorexia Nervosa - binge/purge type) and it is the primary diagnostic symptom of BED and BN. In order to meet DSM-5 criteria for BED or BN, individuals must endorse engaging in a binge eating episode at least once a week for three months. An episode of binge eating is defined as:
"eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., a two hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances," and "lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., feeling that you cannot stop eating or control what or how much you are eating)" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). As the typical age of onset for BED and BN is between the ages of 18 and 26 years (Stice, Marti, & Rohde, 2013), this young adult developmental time period (Arnett, 2007) is a critical time to address binge eating.

Young adults experience numerous unique stressors (such as managing autonomy from parents, developing an independent sense of identity, and navigating peer, familial, and romantic relationships), which make them vulnerable to poor health (Park, Scott, Adams, Brindis, & Irwin Jr, 2014). This period of the life course also coincides with the start of college for many young people. The cumulative stressor model hypothesizes that the co-occurrence of certain stressors during adolescence and young adulthood (e.g., puberty-related weight gain, dating onset, and intensified academic demands) interact to precipitate dieting and other eating disturbed behaviors, such as binge eating (Stice, 2002). Consistent with this cumulative stressor model (Stice, 2002), college students experience a number of unique stressors due to adjustment to college life and leaving home (often for the first time), both of which have been associated with engagement in high risk health behaviors, including binge eating (Phillips, Kelly-Weeder, &

Farrell, 2016). Thus, the college environment is a particularly high risk setting for engaging in binge eating behavior, given the high levels of stress and the age range of most college attendees (Goldschmidt, Wall, Loth, Bucchianeri, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2014).

The association between stress and binge eating has been widely reported. Groesz and colleagues found that higher stress was associated with an increased desire to binge eat among women who ranged from lean to obese weight categories (Groesz, McCoy, Carl, et al., 2012).

Researchers have also shown that women who endorse binge eating report experiencing more stressful life events and rate their daily hassles as more stressful than women who do not engage in binge eating
(Crowther, Sanftner, Bonifazi, & Shepherd, 2001). Similar associations have been found in college and young adult populations. College women who engage in binge eating behaviors consistently report high levels of perceived stress over time (Wolff, Crosby, Roberts, & Wittrock, 2000). Similarly, findings from a study of 1700 adolescents and young adults revealed that individuals endorsing high levels of stressful life events were more likely to endorse binge eating behaviors relative to those endorsing low levels of stressful life events (Loth, van den Berg, Eisenberg, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2008). A meta-analysis supported these results, showing that a confluence of stressors in late adolescence and young adulthood led to increased engagement in binge eating and other eating pathology, supporting the notion of the cumulative stressor model of eating disturbances (Stice, 2002).

The link between stress and binge eating could be explained by the affect regulation model (Whiteside et al., 2007). Specifically, experiencing high levels of stress has been associated with higher levels of negative affect among some individuals (Hammen, 2015). Experiencing negative affect may lead these individuals to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as binge eating (Safer, Couturier, & Lock, 2007), in order gain relief from these negative emotions. Illustratively, a recent systematic review showed that binge eating was immediately preceded by negative emotions and engaging in overeating (to cope with these emotions) appeared to provide immediate relief - resulting in a negative reinforcement cycle (Leehr et al., 2015). The mechanism by which higher stress leads to greater engagement in binge eating behavior has been posited by Goldschmidt et al. (Goldschmidt, Wonderlich, Crosby, et al., 2014) Specifically, these researchers found a mediational effect of negative affect on the relationship between stress and binge eating
(Goldschmidt, Wonderlich et al., 2014). Given that binge eating is associated with numerous negative health outcomes (Stice et al., 2013),
exploring protective factors (such as resilience) that might weaken the association between stress and binge eating is warranted. This knowledge might provide ideas for how to break the negative feedback loop from stress to negative affect to binge eating.

The protective factor model of resilience describes how protective factors can interact with a stressor to reduce the potential of a negative outcome (O'Leary, 1998). Resilience, defined as the ability to achieve positive outcomes despite exposure to substantial risk or adversity (Smith et al., 2008), has received increasing research attention because not all individuals exposed to adversity/hardship develop negative outcomes. Ungar, Ghazinour, and Richter (2013) propose an interactional and multilevel model of resilience, where they purport that resilience occurs as a result of an individual, the environment, and the individual's interaction with their environment (Ungar et al., 2013).

While researchers have examined resilience across various populations, this concept has been understudied among young adults who engage in binge eating. Given that resilience has been associated with numerous positive outcomes among individuals experiencing adversity (Ungar et al., 2013), and college students are susceptible to high levels of stress (Beasley, Thompson, & Davidson, 2003), examining the association between resilience and stress on binge eating among college students will fill an important research gap.

Only a few studies have examined resilience in the context of eating behaviors. One qualitative study conducted in Spain showed that resilience played a critical role in improving the recovery process from eating disorders, such that women who had been successful in their recovery described higher "trait resilience" as a key attribute that helped them stay in recovery (Las Hayas, Padierna, Muñoz, et al.,
2016). In a US-based study, researchers examined factors that might promote resilience in relation to binge eating among college women (Mason & Lewis, 2016). Findings revealed that greater social support from family, more optimism, and lower rumination were associated with a decreased risk of binge eating for Black women (Mason & Lewis, 2016). In contrast, lower social support from friends, more social support from family, and more rumination were associated with an increased risk of binge eating for White women. To date, only one published study implemented an intervention to enhance resilience among college students during a period of increased academic stress
(Steinhardt & Dolbier, 2008). Of note, stress, not eating behaviors, was the intervention target. Findings revealed that students who received the intervention had higher resilience scores, greater positive affect, and lower perceived stress compared to those who did not receive the intervention (Steinhardt & Dolbier, 2008). This research suggests that resilience is mutable and can be strengthened in interventions for college students.

Thus, the current study is poised to address an important gap in the literature by first examining the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating among a diverse sample of young adult college women. Women were the sample of choice given research support for gender differences in binge eating behaviors. Specifically, while some research indicates higher rates of binge eating disorder in men (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007), many studies have found that women are more likely than men to engage in binge eating behaviors (KellyWeeder, Jennings, & Wolfe, 2012) and develop eating disorders
(Kessler, Berglund, Chiu, et al., 2013; Stice et al., 2013). Researchers have also shown a higher prevalence of disordered eating among college women than college men (Quick & Byrd-Bredbenner, 2013). Secondly, we explored whether resilience moderated the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating. We hypothesized that higher stress would be associated with greater binge eating severity and greater resilience will weaken the association between perceived stress and binge eating.

## 2. Methods 2.1. Participants

Participants were 297 female students enrolled in the participant subject pool at three universities across the Western (N = 65) and Southern (N = 232) United States. The sample included women ranging in age from 18 to 25 (M = 19.22, SD = 1.51) with Body Mass Index
(BMI) ranging from 15 to 66 (MBMI = 25.01, SD = 6.18). A total of 5.4% (n = 16) participants were classified with underweight
(BMI < 18.5), 58.2% (n = 173) with "lean" weight (BMI = 18.5–25),
20.9% (n = 62) with overweight (BMI = 25–30), and 15.5% (n = 46)
with obesity (BMI > 30). One hundred and forty-four (48.5%) participants self-identified as Non-Hispanic White, 80 (26.9%) as NonHispanic Black, 30 (10.1%) as Hispanic, 23 (7.7%) identified with more than one race/ethnic group, 15 (5.1%) as Asian American, 3 (1.0%) as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1 (0.3%) as American Indian/
Alaskan Native, and 1 (0.3%) chose not to disclose her race. Majority of the sample identified as college freshman (n = 151, 51.4%), 71 (24.1%)
as sophomores, 43 (14.6%) as juniors, 28 (9.5%) as seniors, 1 (0.3%) as a graduate student, and 3 (1.0%) did not report their year in school. Participants reported their parents' income which was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES). Parent income ranged from less than
$10,000 to greater than $200,000 per year (13.4% of the sample had parental income less than $25,000; 21.6% between $25,000–$49,999; 16.5% between $50,000–$74,999; 11.4% between $75,0000–$99,999; 19.5% greater than $100,000; 17.5% chose not to report).

## 2.2. Procedures

Participants were recruited via psychology research participant pools at three universities and completed study questionnaires online. The inclusion criteria for study participation was identifying as a woman, between the ages of 18 and 25, having internet and computer access to complete the online survey, and ability to read and understand the English language. The study only evaluated women, given the higher prevalence of disordered eating among college age women compared to college age men (Kelly-Weeder et al., 2012; Kessler et al.,
2013; Quick & Byrd-Bredbenner, 2013). Specifically, we sought to explore factors that weaken or strengthen the relationship between stress and binge eating behaviors among college women who have a higher prevalence of disordered eating. Students who were interested in completing the study and met inclusion criteria provided electronic informed consent and responded to online questionnaires. This data collection method is commonly used and has been validated with various psychological measures (Ritter, Lorig, Laurent, & Matthews, 2004; Vallejo, Jordán, Díaz, Comeche, & Ortega, 2007). Participants received extra credit in a psychology course as compensation for study participation. This research was reviewed and approved by each university's institutional review board.

## 2.3. Measures

2.3.1. Demographics Participants reported demographic characteristics including gender, age, race, ethnicity, year in school, and annual individual and parent income.

## 2.3.2. Body Mass Index

Participants self-reported their height (in feet and inches) and weight (in pounds). Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight by height squared and multiplying by 703. Previous research has indicated good reliability between self-reported and measured height and weight in college samples (Quick, Byrd-Bredbenner, Shoff, et al., 2015).

## 2.3.3. Perceived Stress Scale (Pss)

The PSS32 consists of ten items assessing the perception of stress.

Participants indicated the extent to which situations in their life were perceived as stressful using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from almost never to very often. Higher scores indicated more stress; possible range 10–40. The PSS has shown good internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas = 0.82–0.85) in college samples (Roberti, Harrington, & Storch, 2006). The scale also demonstrated good internal consistency in the current study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79).

## 2.3.4. Binge Eating Scale (Bes)

The BES (Gormally, Black, Daston, & Rardin, 1982) consists of 16 items assessing the presence of binge eating symptoms suggestive of an eating disorder. Questions are based on behavioral (e.g., consuming large quantities of food in short amount of time), emotional (e.g., guilt or regret after eating too much), and cognitive (e.g., thinking about weight and feeling shame and disgust) characteristics associated with a binge episode. Each question has three or four weighted statements that mirror a range of severity for each characteristic. Weights are 0–3, with 0 indicating no binge eating and 3 indicating severe binge eating problems. Consistent with previous research (Celio, Wilfley, Crow, Mitchell, & Walsh, 2004), the following cutoff scores were used: 0–17
(non-binge eating), 18–26 (moderate bingeing), and 27 and above
(severe bingeing). The BES has good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha above .8034 and good internal consistency in the current study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91).

## 2.3.5. Brief Resilience Scale (Brs)

The BRS (Smith et al., 2008) consists of six items measuring the ability to recover from and bounce back from stress, as well as one's ability to adapt in the context of stress. This scale differs from other resilience scales which assess coping styles and associated protective factors (Smith et al., 2008). Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed with statements regarding resilience (e.g.,
"you usually come through difficult times with little trouble") on a fivepoint Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Higher scores indicated a stronger likelihood of bouncing back from stress. The BRS has shown adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas = 0.80–0.91) in two student samples (Smith et al., 2008) and criterion validity and reliability (Windle, Bennett, & Noyes, 2011). The scale also demonstrated good internal consistency in the current study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.82).

## 2.4. Analytic Strategy

We conducted a moderation analysis in PROCESS (Hayes, 2013) for SPSS v. 24 to test resilience as a moderator of the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating. PROCESS is a macro add-on for SPSS
software used for moderation, mediation, and conditional process analyses that utilizes a regression-based path analytic framework or ordinary least squares to estimate moderation models (Hayes, 2013). Prior to running the moderation analysis, we conducted regression analyses between binge eating (outcome) and perceived stress (predictor), resilience (moderator), and potential covariates known to be associated with binge eating behaviors, including: age (Stice et al., 2013), race (Lee-Winn, Reinblatt, Mojtabai, & Mendelson, 2016; Striegel-Moore, Dohm, Kraemer, et al., 2003), parent income (as a proxy for SES) (Reagan & Hersch, 2005), BMI (Bulik, Sullivan, &
Kendler, 2002; Goldschmidt, Aspen, Sinton, Tanofsky-Kraff, & Wilfley, 2008; Smith & Robbins, 2013), and region (due to study sampling from Western and Southern U.S. areas).

After determining significant predictors of binge eating, a moderation model was tested in which participants' perceived stress was correlated with the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive characteristics of binge eating, as moderated by resilience. In the final moderation model, BMI was included as a covariate, given it's significant association with binge eating.

With respect to the study sample, one participant was excluded because her BMI score was an outlier at 16.46 SD above the mean
(likely indicative of a height/weight misreporting error), and 13.7% (n = 47) were excluded for missingness via casewise deletion due to missing all items on the perceived stress or resilience measures. Thus, a final sample of 297 young adult women remained, with all variables within the model having 0% missingness. Due to differences in scaling of the measures, analyses were conducted using standardized scores
(range 0–1; corresponding to these effect-size estimates in path analysis: < 0.10 = small; 0.30–0.49 = medium; > 0.50 = large).

## 3. Results

In the current sample, 12.5% (n = 37) of participants met criteria for moderate bingeing (i.e., had scores of 18–26 on the BES) and 4.4%
(n = 13) met criteria for severe bingeing (i.e., had scores > 27 on the BES). Bivariate correlations showed perceived stress to be negatively correlated with resilience and positively correlated with severity of binge eating symptoms. Resilience was negatively correlated with binge eating severity (see Table 1).

BMI, resilience, and perceived stress were significant predictors of binge eating (see Table 2 for beta coefficients). Accordingly, these aforementioned variables were all included in the final model. Age, race, parent income, and region were not significant predictors of binge eating, and thus these variables were not included in the final model.

The initial moderation model examined resilience as a moderator of

the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms.

Because BMI was found to be significantly predictive of binge eating, a three-way interaction of perceived stress, resilience, and BMI on binge eating was examined via a moderated moderation analysis. All the interactions with BMI (i.e., BMI × perceived stress; BMI × resilience; BMI × perceived stress × resilience) were found to be non-significant. As such, BMI was included as a covariate in the final moderation model, in which resilience moderated the path from perceived stress to binge eating behaviors (R2 = 0.32).

In this final moderation model, accounting for the significant association between BMI and binge eating, perceived stress was significantly associated with binge eating symptoms. Specifically, higher perceived stress was related to more severe binge eating pathology. Resilience was also found to be negatively related to binge eating, such that higher resilience was related to lower binge eating pathology. Moderation was supported, whereby the interaction between perceived stress × resilience was significantly associated with binge eating symptoms (see Table 3). This suggests that the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms varied by level of resilience.

When examining the conditional effects of perceived stress on binge eating at differing levels of resilience [i.e., low (1 SD below mean BRS
score), average (z-score of 0), and high (1 SD above mean BRS score)],
the relationship between stress and binge eating was found to be strongest at the lowest levels of resilience. Comparatively, the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating was weaker for those with moderate resilience. Those with the highest resilience had the weakest relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms (see Table 3 and Fig. 1). Findings suggest that resilience moderates the relationship between stress and binge eating by attenuating the association.

## 4. Discussion

This study examined the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms among young adult college women. A notable shift from research studies that primarily focus on risk factors, we explored whether resilience (a protective factor) attenuated the relationship between stress and binge eating (accounting for BMI).

Overall, our study sample was relatively comparable to college student samples (in other published research) on perceived stress (Cohen, 1988), binge eating (Boggiano, Burgess, Turan, et al., 2014), and resilience (Smith et al., 2008).

In our first aim, which examined the association between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms, we found that higher perceived stress was associated with greater severity of binge eating symptoms, consistent with previous studies (Groesz et al., 2012; Loth et al., 2008; Wolff et al., 2000). Given prior research, which showed that negative emotions preceded binge eating (Leehr et al., 2015), it is possible that the young adult women in our sample who experienced negative affect engaged in binge eating as a means of alleviating their distress. While the current study did not specifically examine negative affect, this potential explanation of our findings is in line with the affective regulation model of binge eating, which suggests that individuals binge eat to cope with dysregulated emotions (Safer et al., 2007).

In our second aim, study findings suggest that resilience may serve a protective role against using binge eating as a maladaptive coping mechanism, given that the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating symptoms was attenuated by resilience. This finding suggests that young adult women who can rebound quickly from stressful life experiences may be less likely to engage in binge eating in response to high stress. This ability to "bounce back" from stress is theorized to occur at multiple levels according to Ungar's interactional model of resilience (Ungar et al., 2013). While this study focused on resilience at the individual level (i.e., one's own ability to bounce back from adversity), Ungar's model describes resilience as occurring at individual, relational, and contextual levels (Ungar et al., 2013). Thus, findings from the current study indicate that resilience at the individual level is protective against binge eating in young adult college women. This is likely because resilience enables these women to more effectively manage stress and the associated negative affect that comes with high stress.

Our findings can be contextualized by a recent study where implementing a resilience-based intervention for college students led to increased resilience and reduced stress (Steinhardt & Dolbier, 2008). While the authors did not directly examine the intervention's impact on disordered eating, the study could still serve as a potential roadmap for ways to increase resilience among college students in the context of stress and disordered eating. Specifically, Steinhart and Dolbier implemented four two-hour classroom sessions focused on transforming stress into resilience at the individual and relational levels, including teaching students about taking responsibility, empowered thinking, and creating meaningful connections with others (Steinhardt & Dolbier, 2008). Compared to a wait-list control, college students who received the intervention exhibited higher resilience and other protective factors scores, used more effective coping strategies, and had lower mental health symptom scores (Steinhardt & Dolbier, 2008). Such an intervention may not only help young people manage stress more

effectively, but could be adapted to help minimize the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects of binge eating.

## 4.1. Clinical Implications

Given the unique stressors associated with the young adult developmental period (Park et al., 2014) and the association between stress and binge eating (Loth et al., 2008), our study has important clinical relevance. Consistent with the affect regulation model, interventions aimed at decreasing binge eating could implement strategies that illustrate how to cope with negative affect and manage stress effectively.

Mastery of these skills could help students better adapt to stressful events, leading them to more readily "bounce back" (i.e., show resilience) in the context of adversity rather than engaging in binge eating to cope with their distress. Binge eating interventions for young adult women should not only target ways to increase positive coping skills but could also consider ways to increase resilience at one or more interactional levels. Our results suggest that resilience at the individual level decreases binge eating behaviors in the context of stress among young adult college women. Future interventions addressing binge eating may also consider ways to enhance resilience at the relational and contextual levels. Resilience-based interventions provide a strength-based approach that may be less stigmatizing than other interventions which directly address binge eating head on (Steinhardt &
Dolbier, 2008).

Findings also illustrate the protective effects of resilience across varying weight statuses. Despite research evidence of higher rates of binge eating among individuals with obesity (Smith & Robbins, 2013), enhancing resilience among all youth with and without obesity could be a novel avenue for preventing and decreasing the trans-diagnostic symptoms of binge eating. Notably, because this study included participants of all weight classes and examined binge eating behaviors broadly, the clinical implications are wide reaching to the disordered eating field.

## 4.2. Study Limitations

Yet, our study is not without limitations. First, our study sample was comprised of a convenience sample of young adult female college students. While college age women are more likely to engage in binge eating (Stice et al., 2013), findings may not be generalizable to college age men and non-college attending young adults who engage in binge eating behaviors, especially those from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds who may not be able to afford to attend college. However, a notable strength was the diversity of our sample with a majority minority sample, which increases the potential generalizability of our findings across racial and ethnic groups. Another limitation was that all our measures were based on participants own self-report. Given that binge eating is highly associated with guilt (Stice et al., 2013), our rates of binge eating may have been under-reported because of social desirability and reticence to admit to engaging in this behavior. However, the use of the binge eating scale allowed for a trans-diagnostic examination of binge eating and the inclusion of a wider range of participants who may have been at risk for full and subthreshold binge eating disorder, bulimia, or anorexia - binge/purge type. This is especially important given that young people who engage in binge eating
(regardless of whether they meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder) are still at high risk for poor health outcomes (Sonneville, Horton, Micali, et al., 2013). Finally, directionality of our study findings cannot be inferred from these cross-sectional analyses, as it may be that those women who engage in binge eating more frequently experience higher stress.

## 4.3. Future Directions

Future studies should examine whether a similar protective relationship is evident for young adult men who engage in binge eating, given previous work suggesting differing levels of binge eating related distress by gender (Lee-Winn et al., 2016). Examination of negative affect in the context of binge eating, resilience, and stress will be important to explore in future research. Additionally, a longitudinal examination of the relationship between perceived stress and binge eating should be evaluated to assist with determining directionality of findings. Future research could expand beyond individual level resilience to examine the influence of multilevel resilience at the relational level
(i.e., parents, peers, teachers, coaches) and contextual level (i.e.,
spiritual connectedness, educational engagement, cultural factors)
(Ungar et al., 2013), to determine how various aspects of resilience attenuate binge eating. Finally, exploring how a multilevel resiliencebased intervention could be adapted and applied in the context of disordered eating is warranted.

## 4.4. Conclusions

Our study contributes to the literature on binge eating as it sheds light on how stress exacerbates binge eating symptoms and how resilience may serve a protective role in this relationship. Given that many more individuals engage in binge eating than meet criteria for full threshold eating disorders, understanding factors that protect young women from the negative mental health consequences of binge eating is valuable to the field. Further, examination of resilience in young adults who binge eat is a novel and unexplored area of research; one that could benefit from the inclusion of resilience into targeted interventions for this population.
