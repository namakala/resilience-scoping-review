The stress process model of caregiving posits that caregivers' internal psychosocial resources may serve as buffers between the stress associated with caregiving and well‐being. Empirical support for the stress process model exists for several caregiv‐ ing contexts, but little research has investigated the Parkinson's disease caregiving experience in Mexico. Using a cross‐sectional, correlational design, the objective of this study was to examine whether resilience moderates the relation between per‐ ceived stress and health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) among Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico. Data were collected from April 2015 to February 2016 during outpatient neurology appointments in Mexico City, Mexico. Participants included in‐ formal caregivers (N = 95) for a family member with Parkinson's disease. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing their level of perceived stress, re‐ silience, and HRQOL. Regression analyses indicated that resilience moderated the inverse relation between perceived stress and mental HRQOL. However, contrary to hypotheses, resilience did not moderate the relation between stress and physical HRQOL. Findings shed light on resilience as a potential protective factor for mental HRQOL among Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico and indicate that resilience may be beneficial to target in mental health promotion interventions.

## 1 | **Introduction**

Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a complex of physical symptoms, such as slow and rigid motoric movements, loss of balance, cognitive impair‐ ment, and psychological distress (Wong, Gilmour, & Ramage‐Morin, 2014). Over time, those who develop the disease lose aspects of their independence and the ability to care for themselves, often re‐ quiring an informal caregiver (Leiknes, Lien, & Severinsson, 2015). Informal caregivers in Western countries provide extensive care for individuals with Parkinson's disease during early stages of the dis‐ ease but may decide to relinquish care when the disease progresses to later stages (Abendroth, Lutz, & Young, 2012). In non‐Western and developing countries, informal caregivers are often the primary caregivers throughout disease progression due to resource con‐ straints and/or cultural aversions to institutionalization of family members (Mahoney, Cloutterbuck, Neary, & Zhan, 2005; Mausbach et al., 2004). For example, in Mexico, family caregiving is typically a highly valued cultural role and one offered through the trajectory of a patient's illness course (Vroman & Morency, 2011).

Caregiving for someone with Parkinson's disease is associated with a range of physical and psychological stressors (Martínez‐ Martín et al., 2015; Roland & Chappell, 2017; Schrag, Hovris, Morley, Quinn, & Jahanshahi, 2006; Trapp, MacKenzie, Gonzalez‐Arredondo,

## What Is Known About This Topic? What This Paper Adds

Rodriguez‐Agudelo, & Arango‐Lasprilla, 2018). Stressors are causes of strain or tension—and for caregivers, stressors manifest as in‐
creased responsibilities due to direct patient caregiving and work within family roles (Pine & Steffen, 2017). Mental and physical stress‐ ors contribute to the accumulation of stress for Parkinson's disease caregivers compared to the general population (Santos‐García & De la Fuente‐Fernández, 2015). Caregiver stress is the physiologi‐ cal reaction in a caregiver that results from changes in the level of assistance a family member requires (Llanque, Savage, Rosenburg, & Caserta, 2016). The stress process model of caregiving has been widely used to examine relations among caregiving stressors, care‐ giver psychosocial resources, and caregiver well‐being (Goode, Haley, Roth, & Ford, 1998). The stress process model theorizes that caregivers' initial inner psychological resources may be protective or may serve as a buffer against potential deleterious effects on health and well‐being over time (Goode et al., 1998).

For example, as a result of the caregiving role, caregivers expe‐
- Caregiving for someone with Parkinson's disease is linked with many negative health outcomes, such as stress, burden, and decrements to health‐related quality of life (HRQOL).

- In samples of caregivers from other countries, resilience has been a protective factor against detrimental men‐ tal and physical health consequences, including poorer HRQOL.

rience constraints within their social lives, financial burden, psycho‐ logical distress, and increased risk of mortality (Flores, Rote, Angel, & Markides, 2019; Maguire, Hanly, & Maguire, 2019; Martínez‐Martín et al., 2005; Schulz & Beach, 1999). Caregiver psychological distress consists of unpleasant feelings or emotions that impact caregivers' level of functioning (e.g., depressive or anxious symptoms; Choi et al., 2012). The challenges of caregiving represent chronic stress‐ ors that negatively impact health by increasing a person's allostatic load—the cumulative burden of stress measured by physiological changes to the body and decline in cognitive and physical health (Dich, Lange, Head, & Rod, 2015). Although caregiving is an indi‐ vidualized experience, together the numerous stressors involved in caregiving increase caregiver stress and distress and put caregivers at risk for detrimental physical and mental health outcomes (Bremer et al., 2015; Hiel et al., 2015).

The mental and physical tolls associated with caregiving can di‐
minish caregivers' health‐related quality of life (HRQOL; Riedijk et al., 2006). HRQOL comprises an individual's overall health functioning along with physical, functional, psychological, and social dimensions of health (Godwin, Ostwald, Cron, & Wasserman, 2013). Among caregivers, reduced HRQOL has been associated with a range of negative health outcomes. Specifically, distress, depression, strain, limited social support, disability of the patient, disease progression of the patient, and deterioration of the relationship between care‐ giver and patient have all been associated with decrements in care‐ giver HRQOL (Litzelman et al., 2014; Markowitz, Gutterman, Sadik, & Papadopoulos, 2003; Martín‐Martínez et al., 2007; Stella et al., 2009; Välimäki, Vehviläinen‐Julkunen, Pietilä, & Pirttilä, 2009).

Moreover, an inverse relation between stress and HRQOL has

caregivers, there is a need to better understand which factors pro‐ mote HRQOL and act as protective buffers.

A protective factor often examined in the rehabilitation liter‐
ature is resilience (White, Driver, & Warren, 2008). Resilience is an individual's ability to adapt, persevere, and maintain emotional equilibrium despite adversity (Warren, Agtarap, & deRoon‐Cassini, 2016). This psychosocial strength has been found to mitigate the effects of stress and promote adaptation (Oken, Chamine, & 
Wakeland, 2015; Wagnild & Young, 1993), yet it has received limited attention in Parkinson's disease research (Robottom et al., 2012). As such, it is unknown whether resilience buffers the negative influ‐ ence of stress on HRQOL among caregivers for individuals with this condition. Accordingly, the present research will examine whether resilience acts as a protective factor among caregivers with a range of stressors.

Resilience in this study is conceptualized as a protective factor and is theorized to buffer HRQOL in the context of caregiver adver‐ sity (see Rose, Holmbeck, Coakley, & Franks, 2004 for a thorough dif‐ ferentiation of protective vs. resource factors). Resilience is an inner resource of caregivers that is hypothesized to affect the strength of the relation between their perceived stress and their HRQOL. Guided by the stress process model of caregiving (Goode et al., 1998; Haley, Levine, Brown, & Bartolucci, 1987; Haley et al., 1996), which posits that psychosocial resources may buffer the relation between care‐ giver stress and well‐being, it was expected that resilience would moderate the inverse relation between perceived stress and HRQOL. 

been well established in the caregiver literature (Bedini, Gladwell, Dudley, & Clancy, 2011; Litzelman et al., 2014). Caregivers with high levels of perceived stress tend to report lower levels of overall well‐being, less sense of cohesion, less social support, increased bur‐ den, poorer family functioning, and decreased physical and mental HRQOL (Goldsworthy & Knowles, 2008; McRae, Sherry, & Roper, 1999). In order to better serve the needs of Parkinson's disease

stressful experiences. The instrument measures resilience with six items on a five‐point Likert‐type scale and has demonstrated evi‐ dence for validity and reliability. In this study, the BRS also dem‐ onstrated adequate support for internal consistency reliability 
(α = 0.73).

## 2.2 | **Procedure** 2 | **Methods** 2.1 | **Measures** 2.1.1 | **Demographic Variables**

An expansive caregiving literature has largely focused on the care‐
giving experience in developed countries (e.g., Canada, the United States), but less work is devoted to regions in Latin America, such as Mexico. Examining factors related to the caregiving experience in dif‐ ferent countries offers insight into cross‐cultural differences and can inform the creation of culturally tailored health promotion interven‐ tions to alleviate stress. This study seeks to expand the knowledge base among Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico.

The present research used a cross‐sectional, correlational, ex post facto design. The study received approval by the Institutional Review Board of the host institution, and the research was con‐ ducted at the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía in Mexico City, Mexico, from April 2015 to February 2016. The study was advertised to prospective participants, or the caregivers of in‐ dividuals with Parkinson's disease who were receiving outpatient neuropsychological services at the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía. Inclusionary criteria included (a) being a genetically related relative or spouse; (b) serving as the main caregiver to the individual with Parkinson's disease; (c) performing caregiver duties for at least 3 months; and (d) being familiar with the patient's care needs and medical history. Exclusionary criteria included having co‐ morbid psychiatric, neurological, or cognitive/ developmental con‐ ditions, which were assessed through self‐report and a structured diagnostic interview. Based on an a priori statistical power analysis 
(power = 0.80, α = 0.05, and a conservative estimation of Cohen's f2 effect size=0.12 based on previous literature) for a model with three predictors (i.e., independent variable of perceived stress, moderator of resilience, interaction term of perceived stress times resilience), a minimum sample size of 95 participants were found to be needed to achieve power of 0.80, so the target sample size for the present study was 100 participants (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).

Before enrollment, participants were provided comprehensive information about the study procedures, and informed consent to participate was obtained for each individual. No participant remu‐ neration was provided. The study was conducted in parallel to the routine neurology visits, which yielded less time burden. Interview administration was approximately 90 min. Interviews were con‐ ducted in hospital offices by a senior neuropsychologist and director of the neuropsychology lab as well as a graduate student research assistant in the Departmento de Neuropsicología, Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía in Mexico City, Mexico. In the inter‐ views, the neuropsychologist and graduate research assistant read questions aloud to the caregivers, who were alone and not in the presence of the individual for whom they provide care.

## 2.3 | **Data Analysis**

All requisite assumptions for multiple regression were tested prior to analysis. An adaptation of the stress process model (Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990) guided the analytic plan. Specifically, two mul‐ tiple regression models examined whether resilience moderated the associations between (a) perceived stress and mental HRQOL and Items related to sociodemographics, including age (in years), edu‐ cation (in years), gender (1 = Man, 0 = *Woman*), length of time as a caregiver (in months), and caregiver relationship (1 = *Spouse/partner*, 0 = *Other immediate family member*) were administered to the partici‐ pants. These variables were included as covariates in the analyses of this study.

## 2.1.2 | **Health‐Related Quality Of Life**

A Spanish version of The Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36; Ware, Snow, Kosinski, & Gandek, 2000) was used to measure mental and physical HRQOL. The Spanish version of the SF‐36 has been effec‐ tively applied to neurorehabilitation caregiver studies within Latin America (Arango‐Lasprilla et al., 2011; Mickens, Perrin, Aguayo, Macias, & Arango‐Lasprilla, 2013; Trapp et al., 2015). The SF‐36 as‐ sesses social functioning, physical functioning, emotional role‐limita‐ tions, physical role‐limitations, mental health, general health, vitality, and pain. Two aggregates of these factors were computed to assess overall physical and mental HRQOL. A large‐scale study examining the psychometrics of the SF‐36 demonstrated Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.78–0.93 (Ware et al., 1995). In this sample, the SF‐36 demonstrated strong support for internal consistency (α = 0.93).

## 2.1.3 | **Perceived Stress**

A Spanish version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983) measured the degree of stress symptoms ex‐ perienced by respondents. The PSS contains 14 items that are rated on a five‐point Likert‐type scale. The PSS has been effectively used in previous Latin American rehabilitation research (Arango‐Lasprilla et al., 2014) and has demonstrated adequate psychometric properties (Cohen et al., 1983). The PSS also demonstrated adequate support for internal consistency reliability in the present study (α = 0.50).

## 2.1.4 | **Resilience**

A Spanish version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008) measured overall caregiver resilience. This measure of

(b) perceived stress and physical HRQOL. The PROCESS modelling tool (Hayes, 2012) was used to test interaction effects. Out of con‐
sideration of potential multicollinearity, the variables were centered and an interaction term was computed. Resampling, in the form of bootstrapping, was conducted to acquire bias‐corrected estimates of population parameters (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). An alpha level of 0.05 determined significant associations. Statistical analyses were conducted with spss 24.0 (IBM Corp., 2016). Covariates included in the present analyses were age, education, gender, length of time as a caregiver, and caregiver relationship.

with the average time spent as caregiver being approximately 93.05 months, or 7.75 years.

Standard descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations, ranges) and correlations among the variables were examined (see Table 1). The first model examined the role of resilience as a moderator on perceived stress and mental HRQOL while controlling for age, edu‐ cation, gender, length of time as a caregiver, and caregiver relation‐ ship. These variables accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in mental HRQOL, F(8, 86) = 12.98, p < 0.0001. Resilience (B = 1.11, t(86) = 2.72, p = 0.008, 95% CI [0.30, 1.92]) and perceived stress (B = −2.80, t(86) = −6.90, p < 0.0001, 95% CI [−3.61, −1.99]) sig‐ nificantly predicted mental HRQOL. The interaction term between perceived stress and resilience accounted for a significant propor‐
tion of the variance in mental HRQOL, ΔR2 = 0.02, ΔF(1, 86) = 6.52, p = 0.01. Resilience moderated the relation between stress and men‐ tal HRQOL, B = 0.18, t(86) = 2.55, p = 0.01, 95% CI [0.04, 0.33] (see Figure 1). No covariates included in this model were significantly as‐ sociated with mental HRQOL.

The second model examined the role of resilience as a moder‐
ator of the relation between perceived stress and physical HRQOL while controlling for age, education, gender, length of time as a caregiver, and caregiver relationship. These variables accounted Participants (N = 102) included caregivers of individuals with Parkinson's disease from Mexico. From the total sample, seven were excluded for being a professional caregiver and not informal, familial caregivers. Thus, the final sample was comprised of 95 in‐ formal familial caregivers of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The participants were either a spouse/partner (60%; n = 57), child (26.3%; n = 25), sibling (9.5%; n = 9), or a parent (4.2%; n = 4) of the individual with Parkinson's disease. The mean age of the par‐ ticipants was 51.1 (SD = 13.9) years. Most participants were fe‐ male (78%; n = 74). Mean education completed was 10.99 years of schooling, or less than high school diploma, and education lev‐ els reported by participants ranged from some primary to post‐ graduate education. Participants reported caring for their family member with Parkinson's disease for between 3 and 32 years,

In this model, perceived stress (B = −1.16, t(86) = −2.45, p = 0.02, 95% CI [−2.10, −0.22]), but not resilience (B = 0.89, t(86) = 1.76, p = 0.08, 95% CI [−0.11, 1.89]), significantly predicted physical HRQOL. The interaction term did not account for significantly more variance in physical HRQOL than stress and re‐
silience alone, ΔR2 = 0.01, p = 0.20, 95% CI [−0.07, 0.32]. Together, moderation was not indicated in this model. The only covariate as‐ sociated with physical HRQOL in this model was age (B = −0.56, t(86) = −3.36, p = 0.001, 95% CI [−0.90, −0.23]).

## 4 | **Discussion**

In accordance with the stress process model of caregiving (Haley et al., 1987, 1996; Pearlin et al., 1990), this study examined whether resilience would moderate relations between perceived stress and mental and physical HRQOL. Although the relation between stress and HRQOL has been established in a range of health‐related con‐ texts, little research has focused on its role among caregivers of someone with Parkinson's disease or within a Latin American car‐ egiving context. This study fills a gap in the literature by examin‐ ing resilience as a protective factor in the lives of this understudied group of caregivers. Findings stand to inform clinical treatment in‐ terventions with informal caregivers in Mexico.

Previous research has found an inverse relation between per‐
ceived stress and HRQOL among caregivers (Bedini et al., 2011; Litzelman et al., 2014). Consistent with these findings, Parkinson's disease caregivers in the present study who endorsed high levels of stress tended to have lower levels of mental and physical HRQOL. 

![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)

Moreover, resilience was found to moderate the relation between perceived stress and mental—but not physical—HRQOL. These dif‐ ferences might be explained by the emphasis the resilience mea‐ surement placed on affective and cognitive forms of 'bouncing back' from adversity (Smith et al., 2008). In light of this, it is possible that the scale did not account for bio‐behavioural manifestations of re‐ silience that would associate with better physical HRQOL. Together, this suggests caregiver resilience acted as buffer to protect mental health but was not protective of physical HRQOL among this group of caregivers.

Informal caregivers can endure a range of burdens associated with their role. In turn, this makes identifying points of intervention (e.g., building resilience) essential. It is possible that interventions aimed at promoting mental HRQOL among informal caregivers may benefit from a focus on building resilience. Several proxies for build‐ ing resilience have been identified, including enhancing caregiver coping skills, self‐efficacy, and competence. Methods for interven‐ tion often include psychoeducation, psychotherapy, support groups, and skills training, among other forms (e.g., meditation; Petriwskyj, Parker, O'Dwyer, Moyle, & Nucifora, 2015; Zauszniewski, Lekhak, Burant, Variath, & Morris, 2016). Caregiver interventions may bene‐ fit from targeting affective, cognitive, and behavioural forms of resil‐ ience building to improve mental HRQOL.

In addition to expanding the resilience literature to Parkinson's disease caregivers, the present study extends the stress process model of caregiving (Haley et al., 1987) to a sample of Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico. This study found that Mexican Parkinson's disease caregivers who are resilient in the face of stress tended to experience higher mental HRQOL, which is similar to find‐ ings for caregivers from other countries (Dias et al., 2015). These findings demonstrate cross‐cultural similarities in the role of resil‐ ience in buffering caregiver stress and its negative outcomes. Given the limited information on Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico, future research should investigate culture‐specific factors, such as familismo, related to the Parkinson's disease caregiving experience.

This study is not without limitations. The principal finding that resilience buffers the relation between perceived stress and mental HRQOL among Parkinson's disease caregivers in Mexico is cross‐sec‐ tional in nature. Although not a methodological flaw, the study de‐ sign limits our understanding of temporal changes among the factors examined. Future research should longitudinally evaluate whether resilience is a consistent buffer against experiencing poor HRQOL outcomes over time. In addition, the internal consistency reliability of the PSS was relatively lower than typically desirable estimates. Although this scale has received support for reliability and validity in past research with Latin American rehabilitation samples (e.g., Arango‐Lasprilla et al., 2014), future research should consider the psychometric properties of this construct across diverse populations. Furthermore, this study sampled a group of informal familial care‐ givers from an outpatient neurological care center in Mexico City, Mexico, which limits generalizability from extending to caregivers from rural areas in Mexico. The realities of caregiving certainly differ

across Central and South American countries as well as areas within Mexico (i.e., rural or geographically isolated vs. urban areas). Future work would benefit from more generalizable samples comprised of caregivers of diverse sociodemographic characteristics from differ‐ ing regions. In addition, the stress process model of caregiving high‐ lights many inner resources that could mitigate the burden of chronic caregiver stress (Haley et al., 1987). Other potential variables should be examined in future research that may buffer the relation between perceived stress and caregiver HRQOL. In particular, cultural aspects of caregiving that are unique to caregivers in Mexico (e.g., *familismo* or other traditional Latino values) should be explored.

Clinical treatments can utilize findings from the pres‐ ent study to tailor interventions to alleviate the significant, chronic stress experienced by informal familial caregivers.
