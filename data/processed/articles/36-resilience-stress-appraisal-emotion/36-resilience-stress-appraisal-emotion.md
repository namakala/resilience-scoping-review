Recent reviews of occupational resilience have called for this personal resource to be included as both a predictor and moderator of the stress appraisal-emotion relationship. This research addresses these calls by investigating how employees' self-reports of daily challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisals relate to their daily work-related positive affect, anger, and anxiety, while assessing both the main and moderating effects of resilience. Data were collected through daily diaries from 318 employees over five consecutive workdays (1,502 daily observations). Results were supportive of the distinct appraisalemotion relationships, as daily challenge appraisal positively predicted daily work-related positive affect, daily hindrance appraisal positively predicted daily work-related anger, and daily threat appraisal positively predicted daily work-related anxiety.

Results of the moderating effect of resilience on these relationships were mixed. Despite resilience positively predicting positive affect and negatively predicting anger and anxiety, resilience only appeared to buffer the daily hindrance-anger relationship. While further research is required to understand which personal resources are the most effective in promoting employee wellbeing, this research is supportive of the influence of both stressor appraisal and resilience in understanding occupational wellbeing, particularly the benefit of challenge appraisal and resilience in promoting emotional wellbeing.

## Introduction

With the increase of occupational stressors many employees are required to manage in the modern workplace, it is important to understand the factors that assist employees to adapt to their increasingly pressurised workplaces. Personal resources, particularly resilience, have become increasingly important in investigating how employee traits can assist in positive adaptation to occupational stress (Hartmann et al., 2020).

Defined as "the dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity" (Luthar et al., 2000, p. 543), occupational stress researchers have demonstrated that trait resilience can impact employees' perceived exposure to numerous occupational stressors (e.g. Crane & Searle, 2016) and challenge and threat

appraisal (e.g. Mitchell et al., 2019). Lazarus (1991b) expanded the transactional model of stress and coping to include assessments of emotional outcomes within the stress process.

However, recent reviews of resilience have concluded that resilience research has primarily adopted Conservation of Resources (COR; Hobfoll, 1989) and Broaden-and-Build
(Fredrickson, 2001) theoretical perspectives. Scholars are now calling for more integrated assessments of resilience in predicting employee emotional wellbeing (Hartmann et al., 2020). In particular, the challenge-hindrance framework (Cavanaugh et al., 2000) is useful in determining how employee exposure to challenge and hindrance demands (and appraisal) can enhance or deplete resilience in predicting emotional outcomes (Britt et al., 2016; Crane & Searle, 2016; Searle et al., 2022). Furthermore, investigations of how resilience moderates the relationships between stress appraisal and work-related affect is relatively novel in occupational stress research (Hartmann et al., 2020).

In this research, we address these calls by investigating resilience within the stress process, by combining the cognitive transactional stress model (i.e. appraisal) with the resource-based COR and Broaden-and-Build theories, in order to clarify how the personal resource of resilience can enhance or buffer the relationships between daily cognitive appraisal and daily emotional outcomes. More specifically, this paper aims to distinguish daily challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisal in predicting daily workrelated positive affect, anger, and anxiety respectively, while testing both the main and moderating effects of trait resilience in enhancing the challenge appraisal-positive affect process, and buffering the hindrance appraisal-anger and threat appraisalanxiety processes (see Figure 1).

## Stressor Appraisal And Related Emotional States

While the original conceptualisation of the transactional model of stress emphasised the appraisal, coping, and event outcomes of the stress process (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), later revisions have expanded the theory to be inclusive of co-occurring positive and negative emotional states (Folkman, 1997; Lazarus, 1991b). According to the transactional model, individuals can perceive an event as either irrelevant, benign-positive, or stressful (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Stressful events can either be appraised as a threat due to the potential of a stressor to cause personal harm or loss (threat appraisal)
or appraised as a challenge due to the potential for gain, mastery, and/or growth (challenge appraisal; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Depending on the success of activated coping strategies (e.g. problem or emotion-focused coping), positive emotions generally occur if the coping strategies were successful in overcoming or reducing the negative impact of the stressor, compared to negative emotions if the stressor was not successfully overcome
(Folkman, 1997). Emotional states are crucial to an individual's ability to successfully adapt to their stressors, particularly due to each emotions' "core relational theme"
(Lazarus, 1991b, 2006). For instance, positive emotional states such as joy, pride, and happiness have core relational themes of making reasonable progress towards one's goals and life achievements (i.e. challenge appraisal). Negative emotional states, such as anxiety, have a core relational theme of uncertain, existential threats to one's self
(i.e. threat appraisal; Lazarus, 1991b; Lazarus, 1999, 2006). That is, the core relational theme of positive affect is associated with challenge appraisal, while the core relational theme of anxiety is associated with threat appraisal.

Given Lazarus' focus on affective wellbeing within the transactional model, it is important to define this concept. According to the affective components of the tripartite model of subjective wellbeing (Busseri & Sadava, 2011), subjective wellbeing is defined as having a high level of life satisfaction and positive affect while experiencing lower frequencies of negative affect. The positive and negative affective states associated with challenge and threat appraisal, respectively, are effective indications of subjective affective wellbeing
(Busseri & Sadava, 2011). By measuring employees' frequency of positive (e.g. enthusiasm and contentment) and negative (e.g. anxiety and anger) affect, the benefits of challenge appraisal on affective wellbeing can be supported, especially given that individuals experiencing more positive affect compared to negative affect tend to function more effectively when faced with hardship (Busseri & Sadava, 2011). For example, Tuckey et al. (2015) found challenge appraisal to be associated with higher frequencies of enthusiasm while threat appraisal was associated with higher frequencies of anxiety.

While the transactional model has been successful in operationalising the complexities of stress, Cavanaugh et al. (2000) formulated the challenge-hindrance framework informed by the transactional stress model to understand the effects of different types of job demands on occupational wellbeing outcomes. The challenge-hindrance model integrates the challenge-threat appraisal dichotomy of the transactional model to distinguish job demands into either challenge job demands or hindrance job demands (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Challenge job demands refer to job stressors that are stressful but have the potential for employees to master, grow, and learn from them (e.g. time pressure, learning demands, job responsibility) and are consistent with challenge appraisal (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Hindrance job demands refer to demands that constrain learning opportunities and goal achievement (e.g. role ambiguity, organisational constraints) and are consistent with threat appraisal (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). However, the challenge-hindrance framework has been criticised for overlooking cognitive appraisal and assuming job demands are always challenging or hindering regardless of individual and/or occupational differences (Searle & Auton, 2015; Webster et al.,
2011). Knowledge of this fundamental aspect of the transactional model has been limited, as the majority of studies have assumed that challenge and hindrance job demands elicit challenge or hindrance appraisals, rather than directly assessing individual employees' stress appraisal (Webster et al., 2011). Research has now emphasised the importance of directly testing challenge and hindrance appraisal, so as to improve our understandings of how employee appraisals of their job demands actually impact their levels of wellbeing (Searle & Auton, 2015). For example, Searle and Auton (2015) found time pressure to be appraised as both a challenge and a hindrance and that these appraisals predicted unique variance in emotional outcomes including positive affect and anger. Li et al.

(2020) reported similar results as time pressure was appraised as both a challenge and a hindrance, role conflict increased challenge appraisal, while emotional demands were not appraised as either a challenge or a hindrance, emphasising the importance of primary appraisal in accurate assessments of occupational stress.

The transactional stress model primarily focuses on two types of cognitive appraisal:
challenge and threat appraisal (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). The challenge-threat appraisal dichotomy has been widely researched (e.g. Kilby et al., 2018). However, this dichotomy alone may not be sufficient to understand the complexity of the occupational stress process, particularly within the challenge-hindrance framework. Tuckey et al. (2015) argued the challenge-hindrance framework exchanges hindrance appraisal with threat appraisal when, in fact, the framework can include three types of appraisal: challenge, hindrance, and threat. There are two important distinctions to note between hindrance and threat appraisal. First, the definition of threat appraisal is focused on the self and is centred around future harm/loss, whereas hindrance appraisal is focused on the obstruction of goals, learning, and achievement (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Searle & Auton, 2015; Tuckey et al., 2015). Second, threat appraisal is primarily associated with emotional exhaustion and anxiety, while hindrance appraisal is primarily associated with anger, venting, and fatigue (Searle & Auton, 2015; Tuckey et al., 2015; Williamson Smith et al., 2022). While hindrance appraisal was not included in the original transactional stress model, Searle and Auton (2015) noted hindrance appraisal stems from a frustration viewpoint, which was acknowledged as a primary appraisal in later commentaries of the transactional model (Lazarus, 1991b). From an occupational stress perspective, the challenge-hindrance (and threat) framework has been crucial in distinguishing the various appraisal-emotion relationships (Searle et al., 2022; Stiglbauer, 2018; Tuckey et al., 2015).

The first aim of the current research is to distinguish between challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisal through multiple emotional outcomes as theorised by the transactional model of stress and coping (Lazarus, 1991a, 1991b, 1999; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). As challenge appraisal is theorised to promote goal achievement and learning (Searle & Auton, 2015; Tuckey et al., 2015), it is expected that challenge appraisal will be associated with higher positive affect. In relation to the goal obstructing nature of hindrance appraisal, positive associations with anger and frustration is expected due to the extra effort needed to overcome these stressors (Lazarus, 1991b; Searle & Auton, 2015).

Finally, as threat appraisal is focused on threats to the self (Tuckey et al., 2015), it is expected that positive associations with anxiety will occur.

Hypothesis 1: There will be positive daily relationships between daily primary appraisal and daily work-related affect. That is, the daily regression slopes between daily challenge appraisal and daily positive affect (H1a), daily hindrance appraisal and daily anger (H1b), and daily threat appraisal and daily anxiety (H1c) will each be positive.

## The Role Of Resilience Within The Stress Process

Lazarus (1991a) argued individual differences exist in perceived capacities to adapt to stressful events, such that some events may be appraised as a challenge, while others as a threat. These capacities became known as personal resources, and are defined as characteristics of an individual and their perceived capacity to overcome stressors and successfully adapt to their environment (Hobfoll et al., 2003). Personal resources have become integral to understanding what factors enhance or deplete employee wellbeing, and resilience in particular, has achieved notable empirical attention to date (Hartmann et al., 2020). While Luthar et al. (2000) posit resilience results in positive adaptation in the context of adversity, the context of adversity needs to be fully considered. In the context of occupational stress, adversity can be a lower intensity circumstance (e.g. being asked to perform a task outside of an employee's knowledge or ability) but can be higher in frequency (Fisher et al., 2018). This form of adversity can initiate a challenge appraisal due to the task increasing an employee's knowledge or skill base, but could also initiate a threat appraisal due to the task being unachievable due to being outside the employee's experience, which negatively impacts wellbeing (Hartmann et al., 2020). Positive adaptation occurs when the employee either returns to baseline wellbeing levels, or even increases their wellbeing levels due to overcoming the stressor (Gloria et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2020; Luthar et al., 2000).

Resilience research has primarily been investigated from resource-based theoretical perspectives, with research primarily adopting a COR (Hobfoll, 1989) or a Broadenand-Build theoretical base (Fredrickson, 1998). COR concerns the salience of resource gain and resource loss operationalised through gain and loss spirals. Gain spirals occur when excessive personal resources create additional resources, thus employees being able to be more resistant (i.e. positively adapt) to future stressors (Hobfoll, 2001). Loss spirals specify that resource loss causes future resource loss, such that over time employees have less resource availability when facing stressful events, thus becoming more susceptible to stressors (Hobfoll, 2001). In a similar manner, Broaden-andBuild theory argues the importance of positive emotions in enhancing employee wellbeing (Fredrickson, 1998). Employees who experience positive emotions tend to have broadened actions and thoughts which allow for additional resources such as social support, resilience, and knowledge to be gained to cope with future threats, as compared to employees who experience less positive emotion (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001).

Due to resilience's capability to assist individuals to overcome adversity (Luthar et al.,
2000), the gain and loss spirals theorised by both COR and Broaden-and-Build theories have been assessed in investigations of resilience. For example, Gloria and Steinhardt
(2016) found that positive affect increased adaptive coping (e.g. positive reframing, acceptance, etc.) which in turn increased resilience, while employees experiencing less positive affect increased maladaptive coping responses such as venting and denial which, in turn, decreased resilience (see also Parker et al., 2015). Similarly, Burns et al.

(2008) found over a period of two months, that positive affect built on increasing positive coping (e.g. positive reframing and problem-solving) and interpersonal trust. As resilience is expected to increase positive affect and, therefore, positive reappraisals of the workplace, resilient employees should experience increased challenge appraisal and reduced hindrance and threat appraisals (Crane et al., 2019, 2020; Hartmann et al.,
2020). Accordingly, research has now begun to investigate the moderating role of resilience in employee wellbeing, particularly during exposure to multiple challenge, hindrance, and threat demands and appraisals (e.g. Crane & Searle, 2016; Mitchell et al.,
2019).

## The Moderating Role Of Resilience In Exposure To Stressors

While recent reviews of employee resilience have demonstrated positive effects on employee emotional wellbeing (Hartmann et al., 2020), research is investigating how exposure to various challenge, hindrance, and threat stressors can also enhance or deplete resilience (e.g. Crane & Searle, 2016; Shoss et al., 2016). Within the challenge-hindrance-threat framework, job demands and appraisal have different emotional outcomes.

Challenge appraisal is primarily associated with positive affect, hindrance appraisal is primarily associated with anger and frustration, while threat appraisal is primarily associated with anxiety (Tuckey et al., 2015). However, the enhancing and buffering effects of resilience between job demands and appraisal and work-related outcomes are now also being investigated and have been recommended in current assessments of the occupational stress process (Hartmann et al., 2020). The ability for an individual to bounce back from adversity can help individuals flourish and achieve their goals (Chen et al.,
2015; Shoss et al., 2016), which increases positive affect and challenge appraisal of future stressors (Crane & Searle, 2016). Thus, resilience should enhance the positive relationship between challenge appraisal and positive affect. Alternatively, resilience can assist employees to reappraise their stressors as challenges, due to the positive adaptation of those with high levels of resilience (Lazarus, 1991a; Luthar et al., 2000; Shoss et al., 2016). Therefore, resilience should buffer the positive relationships between hindrance appraisal and anger, and between threat appraisal and anxiety.

Despite COR and Broaden-and-Build theories differing from the transactional model, recent research has combined COR and Broaden-and-Build theories (operationalised through resilience) with the transactional model (operationalised through appraisal and emotion; Kim & Beehr, 2019; Kronenwett & Rigotti, 2020; Stiglbauer, 2018). Lazarus (2001) argued that resource gain and loss are inherent within the transactional model through the processes of challenge and threat appraisal. As challenge appraisal highlights the potential for learning and goal achievement, it can be conceptualised as a form of resource gain due to these learnings being applied to a similar subsequent stressor in the future (Lazarus, 2001; LePine et al., 2004). Similarly, as threat appraisal highlights the potential for future harm or loss, it can be conceptualised as a form of resource loss (Lazarus, 2001; LePine et al., 2004).

Research investigating the moderating role of resilience between job demands and outcomes has supported these observations. For example, Crane and Searle (2016) reported that resilience moderated the relationship between hindrance demands and psychological strain, such that the positive relationship between hindrance demands and psychological strain was reduced when resilience was high. Shoss et al. (2016) investigated how resilience can buffer the positive relationships between the threat demand of job insecurity and emotional exhaustion. The results indicated that employees higher in resilience had reduced emotional exhaustion and cynicism, even when job insecurity was high (Shoss et al., 2016).

In relation to stress appraisal, Mitchell et al. (2019) investigated the moderating effect of resilience on the daily-level relationships between performance pressure and challenge and threat appraisal. It was found that individuals with high resilience had lower challenge appraisal when performance pressure was low, but higher challenge appraisal when performance pressure was high, as well as weaker threat appraisal
(Mitchell et al., 2019). These research findings support the notion that resilience has an enhancing effect on the challenge appraisal-positive affect relationship, and a buffering effect between the hindrance appraisal-anger and threat appraisal-anxiety relationships.

The second aim of this research is to assess the main and moderating effects of resilience on the appraisal-emotion relationships. As resilience can assist individuals to flourish when facing significant stress (Chen et al., 2015; Crane & Searle, 2016; Mitchell et al., 2019), those high in resilience should have higher challenge appraisal and positive affect, thus enhancing the positive relationship between challenge appraisal and positive affect.

Hypothesis 2a: There will be a main effect of resilience and daily positive affect, such that resilience will positively predict positive affect.

Hypothesis 2b: Resilience will moderate the relationship between daily challenge appraisal and daily positive affect. Such that, the positive slope between daily challenge appraisal and daily positive affect will be stronger for individuals with higher resilience.

Furthermore, from a COR and Broaden-and-Build theoretical perspective, individuals high in resilience should have positive reappraisals when faced with similar stressors over time due to gain spirals (Mitchell et al., 2019; Shoss et al., 2016; Stiglbauer, 2018). Therefore, a buffering effect should occur between hindrance appraisal and anger, and threat appraisal and anxiety. Such that those higher in resilience should have weaker relationships between hindrance appraisal and anger, and threat appraisal and anxiety.

Hypothesis 3a: There will be a main effect of resilience and daily anger, such that resilience will negatively predict anger.

Hypothesis 3b: Resilience will moderate the relationship between daily hindrance appraisal and daily anger. Such that, the positive slope between daily hindrance appraisal and daily anger will be weaker for individuals with higher resilience.

Hypothesis 4a: There will be a main effect of resilience and daily anxiety, such that resilience will negatively predict anxiety.

Hypothesis 4b: Resilience will moderate the relationship between threat appraisal and anxiety. Such that, the positive slope between daily threat appraisal and daily anxiety will be weaker for individuals with higher resilience.

## Method Participants And Procedure

A sample of employees was recruited for this study via two methods. First, a sample was recruited through the first author's personal and professional network (n = 37; 11.64%).

The remainder of the sample was collected through Prolific, an online research recruitment platform (n = 281; 88.36%). Prolific has a growing reputation of providing a valid research participation pool with efforts to provide researchers with usable data from consenting participants, while also placing a heavy emphasis on participant rights and fair payment (Palan & Schitter, 2018). Participants recruited via personal networks were offered gift vouchers and personalised reports on receipt of their responses. Prolific participants were paid the minimum wage for completing the surveys with AU$1.52 being paid to participants for completing the longer Monday and Friday surveys (which included resilience and demographic questions), and AU$0.85 paid to participants for completing each of the smaller daily surveys from Tuesday to Thursday (which included day-level measures only). A total of AU$4.93 for participants completing all five daily surveys. All participants were recruited through an online registration process, which described the purpose and details of the study as well as an informed consent procedure. Participants provided their email address in order to receive daily web-based surveys. The web link to each survey was emailed to each participant at 5pm each workday for five consecutive workdays.

Of the 355 participants who consented to participate, 37 (10.42%) completed two or less daily surveys, 21 (5.92%) completed three daily surveys, 45 (12.68%) completed four daily surveys, and 252 (70.98%) completed all five daily surveys. The final sample consisted of N = 318 employees who completed at least three of the five daily surveys (N
= 1,502 observations). Respondents were aged between 18 and 68 years (M = 3.38; SD
= 10.11) and were predominately female (n = 213; 66.98%). Most respondents were employed full-time (n = 268; 84.28%), working an average of 36.98 h per week (SD =
6.14 h). Work experience ranged from zero to 38 years (M = 6.48; SD = 5.89). Respondents' occupations included administration, education, finance, government, health, human resources, information technology, retail, and sales and marketing.

## Measures

Each measures' items (excluding resilience) were adapted to the daily level in order to capture daily fluctuations. Utilising the procedure described by Geldhof et al. (2014),
internal consistencies were calculated separately for both within (Î±w) and between (Î±b)
persons for the appraisal and work-related emotion day-level measures. The internal consistency for resilience was calculated separately due to being a between-persons measure. Challenge appraisal, hindrance appraisal, threat appraisal, and work-related anxiety, activated positive affect, and anger were measured each day from Monday to Friday while resilience was only measured on the Monday survey.

## Challenge And Hindrance Appraisal

Challenge and hindrance appraisal were measured with Searle and Auton's (2015) eightitem scale. The scale measures challenge appraisal (four items) and hindrance appraisal
(four items). The scale was framed around the work tasks that were completed on that particular day ("Please think about the tasks you completed at work today. Please now assess how these tasks affected you today"). Example items include "Today, they showed me I can do well" (challenge appraisal; Î±w = .80; Î±b = .96) and "Today, they restricted my capabilities" (hindrance appraisal; Î±w = .87; Î±b = .98). Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

## Threat Appraisal

Threat appraisal was measured with Feldman et al. (2004) three-item measure. The scale was framed around the work tasks that were completed on that particular day ("Please think about the tasks you completed at work today. Please now assess how these tasks affected you today"), so participants knew what they were appraising each day. Items include "Today, I felt that these tasks were a negative experience for me" (Î±w = .87; Î±b
= .98). Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Work-related anxiety and activated positive affect The MultiAffect Indicator (MAI) (Warr et al., 2014) was included to measure anxiety
(four items) and activated positive affect (APA; four items). Example items include
"Anxious" and "Worried" for anxiety (Î±w = .84; Î±b = .97), and "Enthusiastic" and
"Inspired" for APA (Î±w = .84; Î±b = .97). Item responses range on a 7-point scale from 1 = "Never (0% of the time)" to 7 = "Always (100% of the time)".

## Work-Related Anger

Three additional items were included in the MAI to measure the degree of daily workrelated anger, which were chosen based on previous research (e.g. Rodell & Judge, 2009; Tuckey et al., 2015). Example items include "Anger", "Frustrated", and "Hostile"
(Î±w = .78; Î±b = .87) with identical response options as the MAI above.

## Resilience

The six-item Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008) was included to measure levels of employee resilience. Example items include "I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times" and "I usually come through difficult times with little trouble" (Î±
= .89). Responses range on a 5-point Likert-scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). Three negatively worded items were reverse scored, so high scores indicate high levels of resilience.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in Mplus Version 8 (MuthÃ©n & MuthÃ©n, 1998â2017)
using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) and a random effects model to assess the cross-level moderation of resilience. MCFA and random effects models are employed in hierarchical datasets with daily measurements (Level 1; the daily level)
nested within persons (Level 2; the person level). Three sets of MCFAs and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted on the stressor appraisal, work-related emotions, and resilience variables to test the predicted factor structure of all items at both levels of analysis. First, a MCFA was conducted on the challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisal items with a second MCFA on the anxiety, APA, and anger items to test the three-factor emotion structure. Next, a CFA was conducted at the betweenlevel only to assess the hypothesised one-factor model of the BRS. Finally, all appraisal, emotion, and resilience items were entered into a final measurement model to test the relationships between all latent constructs.

A random effects model was then employed to test the cross-level moderation of resilience on the random slopes between daily primary appraisal and daily work-related emotions. Random effects models are utilised to assess whether there are differences between-persons (i.e. the intercepts) and whether there is variation between each person's regression slope (i.e. the variation of the regression slope at the daily level; Bolger & Laurenceau, 2013; Hektner, 2019). This type of analysis allows both the intercept and slope of each person's regression line to vary, however the average slope and average intercept is estimated to interpret the data (Bolger & Laurenceau, 2013; Hektner, 2019). If there is significant variation of the random slope, Level 2 variables can be included into the model to ascertain whether they explain the slope variation (Aguinis et al., 2013; Bliese & Jex, 2002). In cross-level moderation, the Level 2 variable predicts the random slope (Aguinis et al., 2013; Preacher et al., 2006), in this case, whether resilience predicts the random slope between daily primary appraisal and daily work-related emotion. If the Level 2 variable significantly predicts the random slope, moderation has occurred (Aguinis et al., 2013; Preacher et al., 2006).

As the associations between daily appraisal and daily work-related emotions is of key interest, challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisal were person-mean centred (i.e. daylevel data was centred around each individual's mean) to remove possible confounding between-person effects while resilience was centred to the grand mean as recommended by Enders and Tofighi (2007). This approach is also preferable when examining crosslevel interactions. In the challenge appraisal and APA random effects model, hindrance and threat appraisal were included as control variables to remove any potential confounds of these appraisals on the relationship between challenge appraisal and APA.

Similarly, challenge and threat appraisal were entered as control variables for the hindrance appraisal and anger model, while challenge and hindrance appraisal were entered as control variables for the threat appraisal and anxiety model.

## Development Of Measurement Models

Challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisal model To assess a challenge, hindrance, and threat appraisal measurement model, all 11 appraisal items were entered into a MCFA with three latent factors representing the three appraisals at each level of analysis. All items had ICCs between .37 and .56. One threat appraisal item resulted in negative error variances at the between level, as such, this item's residual variance was constrained to zero at the between-level. This three factor MCFA produced acceptable goodness-of-fit statistics Ï2(83) = 256.37, Ï2/df = 3.09, p
< .001; CFI = .97, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .04(within)/.06(between). To test that hindrance and threat appraisal are distinct constructs, a two-factor MCFA was conducted with all hindrance and threat appraisal items loading onto the same latent variable at both levels. As anticipated, this model produced an unacceptable fit to the data Ï2(87) = 1367.16, Ï2/df = 15.71, p < .001; CFI = .80, TLI = .74, RMSEA = .10, SRMR = .12
(within)/.12(between).

Anxiety, activated positive affect, and anger measurement model The 11 affect items were entered into a MCFA with three latent factors representing each emotion at each level of analysis. All items had ICCs between .49 and .67. The threefactor model produced an acceptable goodness-of-fit to the data: Ï2(82) = 267.88, Ï2/df
= 3.27, p < .001; CFI = .97, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .04(within)/.06(between).

## Resilience

A CFA was conducted to assess this one-factor structure of the BRS. The one-factor CFA
produced acceptable goodness-of-fit statistics Ï2(9) = 128.16, p < .001; CFI = .98, TLI
= .96, RMSEA = .09, SRMR = .02.

## Full Measurement Model

In the final step, the appraisal, affect, and resilience models were combined into a full measurement model. The negative residual variance of the threat appraisal item at the between-level was constrained to zero based on the respective stress appraisal model.

The resulting seven-factor model produced a good fit to the data: Ï2(524) = 1078.58, Ï2/df = 2.06, p < .001; CFI = .97, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .03, SRMR = .04(within)/.06
(between). For the random effects models, observed variables (mean scale scores) were employed rather than latent variables, to reduce the complexity of the parameters being estimated and to improve the ease of interpretation.

## Results Scale Descriptives

As shown in Table 1, all ICCs ranged between .50 and .74, indicating sufficient proportions of variance at both the between and within-levels. Challenge appraisal was negatively related to threat appraisal only at the within-level, positively related to positive affect (at both levels), and negatively to anger only at the within-level. Hindrance appraisal demonstrated high positive associations at both levels of analyses with threat appraisal, anger, and anxiety, while being negatively related to positive affect at the within-level and resilience as expected. Threat appraisal was negatively related to positive affect and resilience, while demonstrating positive associations with anger and anxiety. In relation to emotional outcomes, anger and anxiety demonstrated positive associations with each other, while positive affect was negatively related to anger and anxiety at the within-level.

## The Effects Of Daily Appraisal On Daily Work-Related Affect

Table 2 summarises the mutlilevel estimates and reports the mean value of the random slopes of the relationships between daily challenge appraisal and daily positive affect, daily hindrance appraisal and daily anger, and daily threat appraisal and daily anxiety, while controlling for the remaining two appraisals. The mean values for all three random slopes were significantly positive, indicating positive relationships between daily challenge appraisal and daily positive affect, daily hindrance appraisal and daily anger, and daily threat appraisal and daily anxiety, supporting Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively.

The main and moderating effects of resilience on stress appraisal and workrelated emotions In each of the three random effects models, a cross-level moderation model was tested that included primary appraisal and work-related emotions at both levels of analysis (controlling for the remaining two appraisals), and resilience at the between-person level (i.e. a challenge appraisal and activated positive affect model, a hindrance appraisal and anger model, and a threat appraisal and anxiety model). Each of the three models estimated the random slope of the within-person path from primary appraisal to work-related emotions and how this slope was influenced by resilience (Preacher et al.,
2006). If significant moderation occurred, simple slopes analyses were conducted
(Dawson, 2014).

The main and moderating effects of resilience on challenge appraisal and positive affect The main effects of resilience predicting positive affect was significantly positive
(Table 3), supporting Hypothesis 2a. This indicates that resilience positively predicts work-related positive affect. However, the cross-level moderation of resilience was not significant, offering no support for Hypothesis 2b.

appraisal and anger.
The main and moderating effects of resilience on hindrance appraisal and anger The main effects of resilience predicting work-related anger was significantly negative
(Table 3), supporting Hypothesis 3a. This indicates that resilience negatively predicts work-related anger. Results showed that resilience moderated the within-person effect of hindrance appraisal on work-related anger. Figure 2 depicts the interaction between daily hindrance appraisal and work-related anger for low (â1 SD) and high (+1 SD)
levels of resilience. At low levels of resilience, the simple slope was significantly positive
(.18, p < .05), while at high levels of resilience, the simple slope was not significant. This indicates that there was a positive relationship between hindrance appraisal and workrelated anger at lower levels of resilience while no relationship at higher levels of resilience. These results support Hypothesis 3b.

The main and moderating effects of resilience on threat appraisal and anxiety The main effects of resilience predicting daily anxiety was significantly negative (Table 3),
supporting Hypothesis 4a. This indicates that resilience negatively predicts work-related anxiety. However, the cross-level moderation of resilience was not significant, offering no support for Hypothesis 4b.

## Discussion

This study aimed to combine the appraisal-based transactional model of stress and coping with the resource-based COR and Broaden-and-Build theories, to investigate how the personal resource of resilience influenced the appraisal-emotion relationships.

Furthermore, this study utilised a daily diary research design to understand the crosslevel moderation of resilience between stress appraisal and work-related emotions.

Results supported the distinct appraisal-emotion relationships, as daily challenge appraisal positively predicted daily positive affect, daily hindrance appraisal positively predicted daily anger, and daily threat appraisal positively predicted daily anxiety after controlling for the remaining two appraisals (H1a, H1b, and H1c). Resilience also appeared to positively predict activated positive affect (H2a) and negatively predict anger (H3a) and anxiety (H4a). The moderating effects of resilience on the relationship between appraisal and emotions were mixed, as resilience did not moderate the within-person relationship between challenge appraisal and positive affect, and threat appraisal and anxiety (rejecting H2b and 4b, respectively). However, resilience buffered the within-person relationship between hindrance appraisal and anger (supporting H3b).

## Theoretical Implications

The impact of appraisal on emotional outcomes With the inclusion of emotional outcomes within the stress process (Folkman, 1997; Lazarus, 1991a, 1991b, 1999), occupational stress theories utilising the transactional stress model are required to demonstrate how primary appraisal predicts work-related emotions (Searle & Auton, 2015; Tuckey et al., 2015). The findings reported here are consistent with research distinguishing the multifaceted appraisal-emotion relationships, as challenge appraisal was positively related to work-related positive affect, hindrance appraisal was positively related to work-related anger, and threat appraisal was positively related to work-related anxiety. However, both hindrance and threat appraisal were associated with anger, blurring the hindrance-threat distinction in relation to the frustration hypothesis proposed by Lazarus (1991b). Even though this finding is not unique
(Tuckey et al., 2015), a possible explanation of this finding is suggested by the "stress as offense to self" perspective (Semmer et al., 2019). From this perspective it is possible that employees could feel a sense of anger, dependent on the type of threat stressor being experienced. For example, employees who are assigned illegitimate tasks by their manager or coworker could become angered due to the sense of disrespect shown to them. Alternatively, anger could arise from conflicting demands due to the employee having no clear process to complete the tasks or not having sufficient time to overcome the conflicting demands. To assess this explanation in more detail, future research is recommended to include measurements of daily fatigue, to better distinguish between hindrance and threat appraisal, due to the extra effort needed for employees to overcome the obstacles associated with hindrance appraisal (Tuckey et al., 2015).

The effects of resilience on daily emotions and appraisal In accordance with COR theory's gain spirals (Hobfoll, 2001) and Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 1998), this research examined the effects of the personal resource of resilience in the assessments of daily positive and negative work-related emotions. Resilience positively predicted work-related positive affect, and negatively predicted work-related anger and anxiety, highlighting how resilience can lead to positive adaptations when experiencing occupational stress (Gloria et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2020). According to these findings, employees with high resilience are able to regulate their emotions more effectively, thus experiencing more positive emotions (Crane et al., 2020), consistent with Broaden-and-Build Theory (Fredrickson, 2001).

Furthermore, this research also investigated the relationships between resilience and primary appraisal, moving beyond the traditional challenge-hindrance demand dichotomy (e.g. Crane & Searle, 2016). While resilience was not significantly correlated to challenge appraisal, resilience was negatively correlated with both hindrance and threat appraisal. This finding is consistent with previous research findings examining challenge and threat appraisal (Mitchell et al., 2019), and challenge, hindrance, and threat stressors
(Crane & Searle, 2016; Shoss et al., 2016). These findings indicate resilience can be an effective resource in assisting employees to overcome the negative aspects of their work, allowing more resource investment into the challenging characteristics of the job (Lazarus, 1991a) and increases in other personal resources (Burns et al., 2008; Gloria & Steinhardt, 2016).

The moderating effect of resilience on the association between appraisal and daily emotion The final theoretical implication of this research assessed the combination of appraisal theory with resource-based theories, by investigating how resilience moderates the appraisal-emotion relationships. The research findings offer support for this observation, as resilience buffered the positive relationship between hindrance appraisal and anger, but did not buffer the threat appraisal-anger relationship or enhance the challenge appraisal-positive affect relationship. While this finding is consistent with previous research investigating the moderating role of resilience between hindrance demands and strain (Crane & Searle, 2016), research is generally supportive of the enhancing and buffering role of resilience between primary appraisal and outcome variables (Mitchell et al., 2019; Shoss et al., 2016). However, while resilience is a commonly examined personal resource, other factors could also explain the stressor-strain relationships. For example, as challenge and hindrance appraisal focus on the achievement/obstruction to goals, goal progress may moderate the challenge and hindrance relationships (e.g. Kronenwett & Rigotti, 2020). Furthermore, since threat appraisal is focused on future harm and/or loss, future-oriented coping behaviours like proactive and preventive coping
(Schwarzer, 2000) could buffer the threat appraisal-anxiety relationship (Raper &
Brough, 2021). Finally, concurrent assessments of multiple personal resources would also assist researchers to identify which personal resources are more effective in reducing strain and enhancing wellbeing, such self-efficacy (e.g. Kelly et al., 2020).

## Practical Implications

The findings of this study have several practical implications for the workplace, particularly concerning resilience training and improving work-related emotional wellbeing.

Resilience training programmes (e.g. Crane et al., 2020) commonly train employees in self-reflection to stressor exposure. These practices can encourage employees to consider how current and past occupational stressors could be appraised as learning opportunities rather than obstructions to goals or personal threats, especially if/when encountered again in the future. This approach appears to be useful in preventing loss of positive affect, as well as a reduction in threat appraisal (Crane et al., 2020). By engaging employees in self-reflection, not only can this lead to positive reappraisals of current and future stressors, but it can also lead to more adaptive coping mechanisms, resilience, and positive emotional states associated with employee wellbeing (Crane et al., 2020), including, for example, preparation of proactive coping strategies (e.g. Drummond & Brough, 2016; Raper & Brough, 2021).

Furthermore, job analysis techniques could be implemented to ensure employees are aware of the challenges of their jobs and what aspects of their occupation are hindering their goals and threatening their wellbeing. As this research supports the positive emotional outcomes associated with challenge appraisal, it is important that practitioners are able to work with both employees and their managers to identify how specific learning outcomes and goal achievements can be accomplished to promote wellbeing. Congruent with resource-based theories, this approach may, in the longer term, promote resource gains to further assist employees to flourish in their jobs.

## Strengths, Limitations, And Future Research Directions

As with all research, the current study contains both research strengths and limitations. First, the multilevel design of this research is a fruitful avenue for advancing occupational stress research, particularly understanding how person-level variables (resilience) can influence the daily-level appraisal-emotion relationships. Combining resource-based theories with the transactional model of stress and coping can provide greater insights into the complexity of the stressor-strain relationships. While COR theory and the transactional model of stress and coping describe different approaches to the stressor-strain debate, recent research has acknowledged their contributions and has integrated both perspectives in order to improve our knowledge of the occupational stress and coping process (e.g. Kim & Beehr, 2019; Kronenwett & Rigotti, 2020).

While the current research measured both hindrance and threat appraisal, the high correlations at the between-level suggests that these two appraisal types may not be as distinct as previous research has indicated (e.g. Tuckey et al., 2015; Williamson Smith et al., 2022). Appraisal researchers utilise one of two known methods to measure primary appraisal. The first method was used in the current research with multiple items included for each appraisal construct (e.g. Raper & Brough, 2021; Searle &
Auton, 2015; Tuckey et al., 2015) while the second method includes appraisal definitions for participants, followed by a single challenge-hindrance-threat appraisal item (e.g. Webster et al., 2011; Williamson Smith et al., 2022). The former method appears to result in higher similarities between hindrance and threat appraisal as compared to the latter method whereby participants are aware of the different definitions of hindrance and threat appraisal. Future research is recommended to consider both of these two measurement approaches, to clarify which method is more valid, especially considering the introspective nature of primary appraisal.

Finally, despite utilising a daily diary research design to assess the within-person relationship between primary appraisal and work-related emotions, the current research adopted a generic approach to appraisal and emotions, without considering workspecific events or stressors. Tailoring stress investigations to specific, objective stressors could increase the validity of the research findings, particularly in regards to how appraisal and emotions fluctuate in response to stressor exposure models (Dormann & van de Ven, 2014; Raper et al., 2020). For example, assessing the fluctuations of appraisal in relation to before and after a performance review, reports, or other key stressors (e.g. Burgess et al., 2022) could further justify the integration of the Transactional Model and COR theory.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the current research highlighted the importance of primary appraisal, work-related emotions, and resilience in the stress process. Evidence emerged for the distinct appraisal-emotion relationships, with daily challenge appraisal positively predicting daily work-related positive affect, daily hindrance appraisal predicting daily work-related anger, and daily threat appraisal predicting daily work-related anxiety. This research emphasised the importance of resilience in promoting work-related emotional wellbeing, with resilience positively predicting work-related positive affect, while negatively predicting work-related anger and anxiety. It is recommended that organisational practitioners promote resilience training programmes to increase employee resilience, which can positively influence the reappraisal process. We also recommend that future research consider the assessment of other personal resources in the stress process, to better understand which resources facilitate employee wellbeing most effectively.
