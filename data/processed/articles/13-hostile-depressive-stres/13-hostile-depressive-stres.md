## Abstract

Background Stress has a significant influence on the development of depressive symptoms. An individual's coping style and resilience may moderate the symptoms of depression. This study is aimed to investigate the role of coping styles and resilience to depressive symptoms when individuals are facing stress in life based on racial/ethnic and gender differences.

Methods Enrolled individuals were assessed using the Unfairness Scale, City Stress Inventory, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results Three hundred ninety-six individuals completed the rating scales. There were significant interactions between race and unfairness, city stress (P = 0.006, P < 0.001), and between gender and city stress (P = 0.016). AAs and males suffer more stress than EAs and females. Hostile attitudes and affects act as mediators and significantly affect the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms (indirect effect: B = 0.812, P < 0.001; direct effect: B = 1.015, P < 0.001). Individuals with high resilience reported lower BDI scores. AAs with high stress and medium resilience had a buffer effect on depressive symptoms, while EAs did not.

Conclusion The racial and gender effects of stress on depressive symptoms were significant. Individuals who have frequently experienced stress exhibited a more hostile attitude/affect compared to those who have experienced less stress. Furthermore, individuals who had a more hostile attitude/affect were more likely to be affected by depressive symptoms. Resilience has a protective factor for all participants, and medium resilience had a better buffer effect for AAs compared to EAs. There should be training for boosting resilience in schools and in vulnerable communities.

## Introduction

Stress is the nonspecific response of the body to any demand
[1], which can induce a complex physiological state affecting the body's homeostasis. Psychosocial stress is considered a multidimensional construct that consists of many different components, such as a stressful life, chronic psychosocial stress, and/or ineffective coping with stress that may induce pathological processes and contributes to mental disorders such as depression [2, 3]. For example, studies have shown

* Rufang Wang rufwang@cdutcm.edu.cn 1 Institute of Health Psychology, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China 2 Georgia Prevention Institute, Medical College of Georgia,, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA
that unfair treatment may not only lead to anger, anxiety, and injustice, but also lead to acute stress and poor health consequences [4–6]. Significantly stressful events were also important risk factors in the occurrence of depression [7]. For example, Yazdi, et al. reported that an individual's financial and daily life stressors are directly associated with the intensity of psychological problems [8].

Coping is considered to be part of an individual's psychosocial competence, which includes the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional strategies employed by a subject to endure life's demands [9]. The individual's cognitive appraisal plays an important role in determining the influence of stress response, i.e., different individuals may respond to stress in different ways [10]. Hostility is a personality trait that includes cynicism, mistrust of others, anger, and overt/repressed aggression [11]. Hostile coping is a form of psychological behavior, which can come in different forms: an individual's hostile attitude/affect, an aggressive response, or negative tendencies of various cognitive/emotional/behavioral aspects of a coping strategy. Numerous studies have shown that hostile coping styles are potential risk factors for health problems and disease [12]. Individuals who have more hostile behaviors are more likely to develop depression [13]. Albanese et al. reported that higher hostility may increase the risk of cognitive impairment through altered stress responses [14]. However, another study revealed that an individual's perception and response to stressful experiences can be regulated by some psychological characteristics, such as hostile attitudes, which may reduce the activation threshold for stress responses [15].

Hostile interpretation bias is one of the hostile coping styles that reflect the propensity of individuals to assume hostile or offensive intentions in the actions of others and has a unique contribution to major depressive disorder/symptoms [16]. On the other hand, resilience is defined as, "the qualities that enable one to thrive in the face of adversity" [17]. Youssef et al. confirmed that resilience is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms and suicidal motivation, which indicates that resilience had a certain protective effect [18].

African Americans (AAs) have a higher incidence of chronic diseases than European Americans (EAs), because of the poor living environment, racial prejudice in health care, and the stress of unfairness, which results in a detrimental effect on health [19, 20]. There is growing evidence that suggests AAs have more exposure to chronic stress compared to EAs, which may make AAs more vulnerable to developing depression. However, recent studies have shown that absolute rates of depression remain similar among AAs compared with EAs [21, 22]. AAs' coping behaviors may mitigate the harmful effects of stressful exposures on mental health while increasing the risk of physical ailments [22]. Gender has been regarded as a critical factor of depression, and gender differences in invulnerability to depression are demonstrated to be evident among general populations [23]. The possibility of having moderate to major depression was significantly higher in females [24]. One study showed a moderating effect of gender on the relationship between daily stress and depression, which revealed a significant effect for boys [25]. This

![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png)

study also suggested that the active coping style showed a protective effect for depressive symptoms in girls, while the internal coping style played a comparable role in boys [25].

It still remains unclear whether hostile coping styles increase or decrease the impact of stress on depressive symptoms, and whether there were any racial/gender differences.

Thus, the overarching purpose of this study was to investigate whether hostile coping mediates the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms along with the role of resilience on depressive symptoms. The aims of this study are as follows:
1. To examine whether there are racial/gender differences in stress, coping, depressive symptoms, resilience, along with the interaction/mediation between AAs and EAs, males and females 2. To examine whether coping styles mediate the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms and to find out which kind of hostile coping style plays a significant mediating effect 3. To examine the role of resilience in mitigating the symptoms of depressive symptoms and to explore whether the regulatory role of resilience has different effects on race or gender Figure 1 shows the complicated relationship between stress, coping styles, resilience, and depressive symptoms.

## Method Subjects

The present study was comprised of subjects from a longitudinal cohort study that was established in 1989 to examine the development of cardiovascular risk factors [26]. All subjects were recruited from the southeastern parts of the USA. Participants were classified as AAs if both parents reported having African heritage and/or considered themselves and

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

Fig. 1 The relationship between stress, coping styles, resilience, and depressive symptoms
their child to be AA/black/Afro-American. Participants were classified as EAs if both parents reported that they were of European ancestry, and they considered themselves and their child to be EA/white/Caucasian and are not of Hispanic, Native American, or Asian descent. The study design and selection criteria have been described previously [26].

At the fifteenth visit (initiated in 2008), all subjects were 19 years old or older. Out of the 432 participants who were enrolled at this visit, 396 completed Unfairness Scale, City Stress Inventory, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, ConnerDavidson Resilience Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory Scale, including 182 EAs (97 males and 85 females) and 214 AAs (90 males and 124 females). The Institutional Review Board at the Medical College of Georgia approved the study and written consents were obtained.

## Assessment Of Unfairness And City Stress Inventory (Csi)

The Unfairness Scale and City Stress Inventory were used to assess the internal and external stress that subjects experienced. Unfairness Scale [27, 28] contains five yes/no questions which measure the perception of various unfair experiences encountered in daily life and work. A total score was calculated.

City stress inventory [29] contains 2 factors: neighborhood disorder and exposure to violence. Two kinds of response formats were provided. For items that described events, respondents were instructed to indicate how often an incident of that type had occurred by choosing four responses:
"Never," "Once," "A few times," or "Often." For items pertaining to questions of magnitude (e.g., number of vacant buildings on one's street), the following responses were used:
"None," "Some," "About half," or "Most." A total score was calculated. The Cronbach's alpha of CSI in this study is 0.92.

## Assessment Of Coping Strategy And Resilience

The Cook-Medley Hostility Scale (CMI) was used to assess the coping strategy. This scale is a true-false questionnaire derived from the Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory [11]. This scale exhibits adequate internal consistency, moderate to high test-retest reliability, construct validity [30], and is the most widely used hostility questionnaire in health psychology [31]. Fifty items were classified on an a priori basis. Five subsets were identified in our study: Cynicism, Hostile Affect, Aggressive Response, Hostile Attitude, and Social Avoidance. The Cronbach's alpha of CMI in this study is 0.89.

The Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience. It is a 25-item self-reported instrument that measures the ability to cope with stress and adversity, such as self-confidence, self-efficacy, self-control, optimism, and spirituality/autonomy [17]. The items are scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from: "Not true at all," (scored 0) to "True nearly all the time," (scored 4). The scale rates participants over the past month with a total score of the CD-RISC varying from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting higher resilience. The Cronbach's alpha of CDRISC in this study is 0.94.

## Assessment Of Depressive Symptoms

The Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), a frequently used self-assessment instrument [32], was used to evaluate depressive symptoms. The BDI has shown high construct validity with the medical symptoms it measures. Beck's study reported a coefficient alpha rating of 0.92 for outpatients and 0.93 for college student samples. The Cronbach's alpha of BDI in this study is 0.91.

In this study, BDI was used to quantify the severity of the subjects' symptoms of depression. This self-report instrument includes 21 items. Participants rate the severity of each symptom from 0 to 3.

## Statistical Analysis

All analyses were done using Stata 12.0 software.

Demographic variables were characterized by descriptive statistics (t test for continuous variables). Path analyses were implemented for all variables with structural equation models.

Multiple mediation analyses were conducted to further examine whether there were significant direct or indirect effects of stress and depressive symptoms. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of Unfairness scores, CSI scores, coping (CMI scores), and resilience (CDRISC scores) with depressive symptoms (BDI scores).

Covariates included age, race, and gender. Statistical significance required a two-sided p value of ≤ 0.05. Line charts were used to demonstrate the alleviation of resilience for depressive symptoms.

Means and standard deviations (SD) are shown EA European American, AA African American, CSI City stress inventory, CD-RISC Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, BDI: Beck Depression Inventory, CMI Cook Medley Inventory a maximum of 100. The mean score on the BDI (±SD) was 6.79 ± 7.51 with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 39. No significant differences on the BDI score and CD-RISC score were found between EAs and AAs, nor between males and females.

Regarding hostility, means of CMI subsets scores (±SD)
are presented in Table 1. Significant gender and racial differences are evident in some of the CMI subsets. Females had lower scores on cynicism (p < 0.001), aggressive response (p < 0.001), and hostile attitude (p < 0.001) when compared to males, while AAs had higher scores on cynicism (p = 0.010) and hostile attitude (p = 0.012) than EAs.

## Regression Analysis Of Unfairness, Csi, And Their Interaction On Depressive Symptoms

Table 2 shows the linear regression results of the associations of unfairness and city stress with depressive symptoms, as well as the interactions between AAs and EAs, males and females, and is adjusted for age and gender/race. There were significant interactions between race and unfairness (P =
0.006), as well as between race and city stress (P < 0.001).

Unfairness and city stress had a stronger effect on depressive symptoms in EAs when compared to AAs. Meanwhile, there were significant interactions between gender and city stress (P = 0.016), where unfairness and city stress had a larger effect on depressive symptoms in females when compared to males.

## Structural Equation Modeling

To further clarify the relationship between variables, we performed structural equation modeling analysis. First, we calculated the z scores for unfairness and city stress using the formula T = (X-M)/SD. Then, we added these two z scores and generated the "stress" variable. The relationship between stress and depressive symptoms was estimated with path analyses implemented via 5 coping styles. The structural equation modeling was presented in Fig. 2. Statistical significance of paths was evaluated using an a priori two-tailed alpha level of 0.05. In addition, the overall fit of the models was judged as good with comparative fit index ≥ 0.90 and standardized root mean squared residual ≤ 0.05. Each model estimated all paths simultaneously, adjusting each path for other included paths as depicted in Fig. 2. We found that only two variables

| EAs        | AAs           | Males     | Females      |              |           |              |           |              |              |       |
|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|

| Unfairness | 3.165 (0.47)  | < 0.001   | 1.333 (0.47) | 0.005        | 0.006     | 2.019 (0.45) | < 0.001   | 2.307 (0.49) | < 0.001      | 0.613 |

(Hostile attitude and Hostile affect) as mediators significantly mediated the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms.

In the group test, there was a significant effect from stress via Hostile attitude and Hostile affect on the depressive symptoms for EAs (B = 1.014, P < 0.001; B = 1.079, P = 0.020)
when compared to the Hostile attitude for AAs (B = 0.817, P = 0.001). There was a significant effect with Hostile attitude for males (B = 0.728, P = 0.004) and also for females (B =
0.1.149, P < 0.001).

## Multiple Mediation Analysis

To further examine how coping mediates the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms and its significance of the indirect/direct effects, we conducted multiple mediation analysis. Mediation models were built with stress as predictors. Hostile attitude and hostile affect revealed significant effects in this mediation model in Fig. 3. Results show that individuals who have frequently experienced stress exhibited a higher hostile attitude compared to those who have had experienced less stress (B = 0.717, P < 0.001). Furthermore, in this study, individuals who had a more hostile attitude were more likely to be affected by depressive symptoms (B =
Fig. 3 Path model of mediated relations between depressive symptoms and stress 0.605, P < 0.001). Also, those individuals who have a hostile affect with more stressful experiences compared to others
(B = 0.760, P = 0.011) are more likely to suffer depressive symptoms (B = 0.207, P = 0.016). Overall, the multiple mediation tests for both the indirect (B = 0.812, P < 0.001) and direct effect (B = 1.015, P < 0.001) were significant. The ratio of indirect to direct is 0.800, indicating that 44.4% proportion of the total effect was mediated.

## Role Of Resilience On Depressive Symptoms

We divided resilience into 3 categories based on the percentile of the CD-RISC score: high resilience (CD-RISC score > 75th percentile (n = 93)), medium resilience (CD-RISC score >
25th percentile and δ75th percentile (n = 203)), and low resilience (CD-RISC scoreδ25th percentile (n = 100)). We also divided stress score into 3 categories: high stress (stress score > 75th percentile (n = 94)), medium stress (stress score >
25th percentile and δ75th percentile (n = 204)), and low stress
(stress score δ25th percentile (n = 98)). Line chart was used to show the role of resilience in the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms (Fig. 4). For all participants, individuals with high resilience scores showed lower BDI scores, suggesting that resilience can alleviate the symptoms of

percentile, > 25th and < 75th percentile, and ≥ 75th percentile) by Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (total score ≤ 25th percentile, > 25th and <
depression for those with stressful experiences. For AAs with high stress, medium resilience had a good buffer effect on depressive symptoms, but not for EAs with high stress.

## Discussion

This study has several findings that were expected and some that were not. As expected, we found that exposure to stress was significantly associated with the severity of depressive symptoms. Our results replicated and generalized previous findings to the young adult population. AAs reported that they experienced much more stress and more hostile coping was adopted compared to EAs, even though their depressive symptoms were not more significant than EAs in this study.

Stress had stronger effects on depressive symptoms in EAs than AAs. In large studies of depression, the basic question of whether AAs and EAs differ in levels of depression remains unclear. In contrast, race differences are either non-significant or AAs are at a lower risk of disorder than EAs [33, 34]. For example, George and Lynch interviewed with 1972

African American)/gender (male or female).
participants using latent growth curve analysis. They found that AAs experienced greater stress growth than EAs, while stress had a significant effect on depressive symptom growth for both blacks and whites [33].

In terms of gender differences, males reported more unfairness and more hostile coping than females. However, females scored slightly higher than males in depressive symptoms in this study, although the differences were not statistically significant. Stress had a larger effect on depressive symptoms in females than males based on the results of this study. After puberty, young females were indeed more likely to suffer from depression than young men [35]. However, young males had some coping styles that may reduce the risk of depression
[25].

We found hostile coping (hostile attitude and hostile affect) significantly mediates the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms for all participants in this study (Fig. 3). Hostile coping plays a mutually reinforcing role between stress and depressive symptoms. Our results are consistent with previous literature. For example, Greenglass and Julkunen suggested that individuals who were high on hostility are more likely to distrust others and experienced more stress than individuals who were lower on hostility [30]. Carla Cruz et al. conducted a quantitative, epidemiological characteristic investigation with 1890 participants, suggesting that individuals who have a higher index of hostile behaviors are those who also have a higher rate of depression [13].

Although the overall resilience scores were not different between two ethnic/gender groups in this study, resilience had a protective factor for all participants. This is consistent with the conclusions of some scholars. For example, Poole et al. recruited 4006 adult participants from primary care clinics to assess their resilience and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Their results suggested that resilience moderated the association between ACEs and depression [36]. We found that medium resilience had a good buffer effect on depressive symptoms for AAs with high stress, but not for EAs with high stress nor for males/females with high stress
(Fig. 4). As mentioned earlier, some of the AAs' coping behaviors may mitigate the negative effects of stressful exposures on mental health [22].

As mentioned earlier, hostile coping is one of the factors influencing health problems. Albanese et al. reported that hostility coping was prospectively associated with lower cognitive function [14]. One study demonstrated that increased hostility is associated with poor subjective sleep quality [12]. In addition, Staicu and Cuţov reported that there is a correlation between hostility, anger, aggressiveness, diabetes, bulimic behaviors, and road accidents [37]. Understanding the importance associated with coping and identification of their longterm effects on health is of great importance in promoting physical/mental health along with reducing health care costs during an individual's life span. Through the function of the protective and regulatory role of resilience, we also suggest that there should be training for boosting resilience in schools and in vulnerable communities for both EAs and AAs, especially for females. For example, one study evaluated a novel intervention RiSE (Resilience, Stress, and Ethnicity) designed to reduce chronic stress and build resilience among Black women [38].

This study has several limitations. First, given the crosssectional design, the results cannot be interpreted in a causeeffect fashion, but only associations can be shown. In the next study, we will use longitudinal data to find out whether some variables have a long-term cumulative effect on other variables. Second, we chose CMI which assesses only limited hostile coping styles and may have missed several other hostile coping that were not measured in this study. Finally, in this study, we only selected unfairness and city stress as sources of stress and did not use other sources of stress. In the follow-up study, all the limitations and shortcomings will be improved.

## Conclusion

This study presents new findings on the relationship between stressful experience and hostile coping on depressive symptoms in young adults. Stress had stronger effects on depressive symptoms in EAs/females than AAs/males. Hostile attitude and affect mediates the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms, while resilience has a certain buffer on this relationship for all participants. Understanding these complicated relations between stress, coping, and depressive symptoms may have an important contribution to prevention and treatment strategies for young adults.
