## Abstract

This study examined the predictor and moderator effects of ego resilience and mindfulness on the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being in a sample of Ghanaian college students (N = 431). The results indicated that academic stress was positively associated with both anxiety and depression and that mindfulness and ego resilience were both negatively associated with anxiety and depression. Mindfulness buffered the positive relationship between academic stress and depression but not anxiety. In contrast, ego resilience buffered the positive relationship between academic

academic achievement, African psychology, culture, college students Academic stress has been found to be a significant source of stress among college students (Persike & Seiffge-Krenke, 2012). This stress can have negative consequences for students' academic performance as well as their psychological health (Felsten, 2002; Stoeber & Rambow, 2007). Students are especially susceptible to mental health concerns during young adulthood, as many psychological disorders have symptom onsets during this critical period (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Previous research has found that the most common psychological consequences associated with academic stress include depression and anxiety (Dyrbye, Thomas, & Shanafelt, 2006; Stoeber & Rambow, 2007). Due to the relationship between academic stress and psychological symptoms, it is important that researchers identify protective factors that may buffer students from the deleterious psychological effects of academic stress. Most research, however, has focused on identifying the psychological symptoms of academic stress rather than exploring how students can be protected from these stressors. Furthermore, previous research on the mental health consequences of academic stress has focused on students from Western, predominantly White populations. This study was designed to address these two limitations, and this study examines the degree to which mindfulness and ego resiliency potentially serve as protective factors against depression and anxiety for Ghanaian students experiencing academic stress.

Ghanaian students encounter a variety of obstacles in the pursuit of higher education including limited access to primary education. A mixed-methods study by Fentiman, Hall, and Bundy (1999) found that primary school enrollment patterns in rural Ghana were affected by economic resources, distance, gender issues, health factors, low value for Western education, and poor school environment. The aforementioned issues result in considerable attrition rates among primary school students in Ghana. Some reports of dropout rates between Primary 1 (first grade) and Primary 2 (second grade) are approaching 50% (Fentiman et al., 1999). These data suggest that a high percentage of children never make the transition to junior secondary school and drop out after only a few years of basic education. Despite these alarming statistics, many Ghanaian students manage to negotiate the many obstacles and graduate from secondary school to pursue university-level education.

Ghanaian students who matriculate into university after overcoming obstacles related to limited access to education often find their socioeconomic status affects the quality of their academic experience. For example, higher socioeconomic status will likely influence their familiarity with advanced curriculum prior to entering tertiary education. One study conducted with a South African college student sample found that language proficiency potentially functions as a cultural academic barrier in several areas of academic performance including public speaking, class discussions, writing, and reading comprehension (Leibowitz, 2005). Furthermore, despite access to some information technology services, certain aspects of IT services including slow Internet speed can reduce the efficiency of Ghanaian students (Cooper & Chifamba, 2011). These factors influence how academic stress is experienced by Ghanaian students and consequently lead to adverse effects on their psychological well-being.

## Academic Stress And Psychological Well-Being

Academic stress is the result of stress related to grades and competition for higher education advancement (Persike & Seiffge-Krenke, 2012). Periske and Krenke (2012) assessed adolescents living in countries in three regions of the world and found that adolescents in every region perceived schoolrelated problems to be the most stressful of all their life stressors. This finding was concerning as high stress levels in an academic domain can contribute to the onset of psychological symptoms (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvarnstrøm, 1999).

A study conducted at a university in central Ghana defined academic stress as the demands of an academic situation and the student's ability to meet those demands (Esia-Donkoh, Yelkpieri, & Esia-Donkoh, 2011). They found that Ghanaian students believed that their experiences of academic stress were unpleasant and were accompanied with negative emotions such as tension, frustration, and anger. The research conducted by Esia-Donkoh et al. (2011) concluded that these negative experiences could result in anxiety and depression. They also noted that many Ghanaian students may express these negative experiences physiologically and somatically, as students selfreferred to the university's student clinic complained of stress symptoms such as headaches and excess fatigue. Therefore, familiarity with how students may culturally communicate stress is essential in order to accurately assess the cues that academic stress may be present.

Cultural expressions of psychological symptoms of stress are important to better understand the cultural experiences of Ghanaian students. 

According to Fentiman et al. (1999), the effects of academic stressors in Ghana are exacerbated by the availability of fewer resources. This places additional pressure on students to succeed so that they can gain employment to support their families. Furthermore, many Ghanaian students play significant provider and support roles in their families, who often live a significant distance from their universities (Fentiman et al., 1999). Thus, these students may find themselves experiencing additional stress as a consequence of commuting long distances to fulfill their familial roles as well as their role as a student (Esia-Donkoh et al., 2011). Such sociocultural factors must be considered when assessing the distinctive stressors that Ghanaian students encounter.

Although some studies have examined how Ghanaian students and other students of African descent define, experience, and express academic stress (Esia-Donkoh et al., 2011; Pillay & Bundhoo, 2011), the effects of academic stress on the psychological well-being of African students needs further investigation. One component of needed research would be the exploration of protective factors that might buffer the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being in Ghanaian university students.

## Protective Factors

Two protective factors that may be important to consider when examining the relationship between academic stress and mental health symptoms are the positive psychological constructs: ego resilience and mindfulness. Block and Kremen (1996) characterized ego resilience as a predisposition to resist anxiety and engage the world in a positive way, as manifested by a positive temperament and openness to experience. Block (2002) later added that ego resilience is the ability to adapt one's level of ego control as situations dictate. Research found that due to this adaptive flexibility, individuals with higher levels of resiliency are more likely to experience positive affect and have higher levels of self-confidence and better psychological adjustment in comparison to individuals with lower levels of resiliency (Block & Kremen, 1996). Successful adaptation may also be reflected in the capacity to recover more quickly from environmental stressors (Carver & Scheier, 1999; Davidson, Inslicht, & Baum, 2000).

Ego resilience has been found to be positively correlated with psychological and physical well-being and negatively correlated with psychological distress (Klohnen, 1996; Klohnen, Vandewater, & Young, 1996). Evidence has also shown that ego resilience is positively correlated with academic achievement and with more effective coping styles in students (Swanson, Valiente, Lemery-Chalfant, & O'Brien, 2011; Zhi & Lei-kui, 2005).

Mindfulness is defined as a "state of being attentive to and aware of what is taking place in the present" (Brown & Ryan, 2003, p. 822). Barnes and Lynn (2010) proposed that in order to practice mindfulness, one must use a set of multidimensional skills such as being present centered and having nonjudgmental awareness. These behaviors produce insight and help the individual concentrate with the additional benefit of physiological relaxation 
(Rosenzweig, Reibel, Greeson, Brainard, & Hojat, 2003). Recent research has associated mindfulness with psychological health benefits, including a reduction in psychological distress, medical problems, rumination, and daily hassles as well as an increase in stress coping skills (Brown & Ryan, 2003; Caldwell, Harrison, Adams, Quin, & Greeson, 2010; Rosenzweig et al., 2003; Schoormans & Nyklicek, 2011; Walach et al., 2007; Williams, Kolar, Reger, & Pearson, 2001).

Regarding academic stress, Rosenzweig et al. (2003) investigated the impact of the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction intervention on the psychological well-being of medical students and found that mindfulness techniques produced a reduction in anxiety, depression, and somatization. Barnes and Lynn (2010) also assessed the impact of mindfulness skills on the depressive symptoms of college students over the course of a semester and found that specific components of mindfulness such as nonreactivity and nonjuding skills were negatively related to depressive symptoms establishing the effectiveness of mindfulness for depression reduction. Conclusively, there is a copious amount of research demonstrating that the positive psychological constructs—mindfulness and ego resilience—may serve as protective factors against anxiety and depressive symptoms in students.

## Present Study

The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being, specifically depression and anxiety, in a sample of Ghanaian university students. Specifically, the study examines whether mindfulness and ego-resilience would serve as protective factors and thus moderate the association between academic stress and mental health symptoms. We had three primary hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that there would be a positive association between academic stress and mental health symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety). Second, we hypothesized that there would be a negative association between our moderator variables (i.e., ego resilience and mindfulness) and mental health symptoms (i.e., 
depression and anxiety). Third, we hypothesized that our moderator variables (i.e., ego resilience and mindfulness) would buffer the positive association between academic stress and mental health symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety). Specifically, we hypothesized that the strength of the association between academic stress and mindfulness would be weaker for students high in ego resilience and mindfulness than for students low in ego resilience and mindfulness.

## Method Participants

Participants were 431 undergraduate college students from a major university in Ghana, West Africa, enrolled in Level I introductory psychology courses and Level II and III advanced topics courses. Of the 431 participants who participated in the study, 181 (42.0%) were men and 226 (52.4%) women, ranging in age from 18 to 49 years (mean = 22.4, SD = 3.2). There were 24 missing values for gender of participant. There were 2 (0.5%) freshmen, 255 (59.2%) sophomores, 27 (6.3%) juniors, and 144 (33.4%) seniors. There were 3 missing values for classification.

## Instruments

Mindfulness. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & 
Ryan, 2003) is a 15-item, 6-point (1 = *almost always* to 6 = *almost never*) Likert-type assessment that assesses individual differences in the frequency of mindful states over time (Brown & Ryan, 2003). The MAAS measures dispositional and state mindfulness as they relate to psychological well-being and focuses specifically on the "presence or absence of attention to and awareness of what is occurring in the present."
In their development of the MAAS, Brown and Ryan (2003) demonstrate that mindfulness is a predictor of self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states, with a clinical intervention study finding that increased mindfulness "over time relate(s) to declines in mood disturbance and stress" (Brown & Ryan, 2003). Through the use of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, the MAAS was found to be an adequate and valid psychometric assessment scale, reliable for use in the populations sampled 
(college students and general adult populations), and consistent with theoretical studies on mindfulness and behavioral regulation. To score respondents on the scale, a mean of the 15 items is computed. Higher scores reflect higher levels of dispositional mindfulness, increased awareness of and receptiveness to inner experiences and emotional states, and greater mindfulness of overt behaviors, heightened self-knowledge, and self-regulation (Brown & Ryan, 2003). In the current study, the MAAS Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .84 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .81-.86).

Ego Resilience. The Ego-Resiliency Scale (ER89; Block & Kremen, 1996) is a 14-item measure of ego resilience. Ego resilience is defined broadly as the personality's capacity to adapt to uncertainty (Block, 2002). Respondents complete the ER89 by indicating, on a 4-point scale (from 1 = *does not apply* to 4 = *applies very strongly*), the degree to which statements apply to them 
(e.g., I quickly get over and recover from being startled). An ER89 total score is computed by summing items across the measure. Scores range from 14 to 56, with higher scores indicating greater ego resilience.

Block and Kremen (1996) reported an ER89 Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .76 for a sample of 18- to 23-year-old participants from an urban setting. Test–retest reliability for the same sample over a 5-year period, when adjusted for attenuation, was .67 for the female participants and .51 for the male participants. A Q-sort procedure demonstrated evidence of the validity of the ER89 scale score (Block & Kremen, 1996). Moreover, evidence for the validity of ER89 scores in a culturally diverse population was demonstrated in a study by Al-Naser and Sandman (2000), who found that the measure discriminated between high and low ego resilient Kuwaiti college students. In the current study, the ER89 Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .81 (95% CI = .78-.83).

Anxiety. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y)–Trait Form (STAI–
Trait; Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983) is a 20-item questionnaire that measures an individual's general feelings of anxiety. Using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = *almost never*, 2 = *sometimes*, 3 = *often*, 4 = almost always), respondents are instructed to indicate the frequency with which they generally feel anxious. Prior research has shown the STAI–Trait to demonstrate adequate test–retest reliability and internal consistency as well as convergent and concurrent validity. For example, Spielberger et al. (1983) reported Pearson correlations ranging from .73 to .85 for the STAI– Trait Form and a similar measure of anxiety. The STAI–Trait was also found to correlate with several of the MMPI clinical scales (Spielberger et al., 1983). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the STAI was .89 (95% CI = .87-.90).

Depression. The Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression (CES-D) 
Scale (Radloff, 1977) is a 20-item self-report scale that measures symptoms of depression in the general population, with emphasis on depressive mood (as opposed to the clinical diagnosis emphasis in previous studies). 

It is reported to be an important instrument for identifying high-risk groups that may be at risk for depression and who may be in need of treatment (Radloff, 1977).

In the development of the scale, the 20 items used were selected from items contained in previously validated studies, based on their identification as major components of depressive symptomology. These include "depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance" 
(Radloff, 1977). Emphasis in the CES-D is placed on current state, with each response being given a score from 0 to 3 based on the frequency of the symptom over the past week (0 = rarely or none of the time [*less than 1 day*], 1 = 
some or a little of the time [*1-2 days*], 2 = *occasionally or a more moderate* amount of the time [*3-4 days*], 3 = more or all of the time [*5-7 days*]). Total scores on this scale range from 0 to 60 (for the 20 items), with higher scores on the scale indicating more symptoms associated with depression.

Validation studies found the CES-D to have a high level of internal consistency, test–retest stability, and concurrent and construct validity across the general population subgroups studied (i.e., three age groups, two genders, two races, three levels of education, and two "need help" groups) along four factors—depressed affect, positive affect, somatic and retarded activity, and interpersonal (Radloff, 1977). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the CES-D was .86 (95% CI = .84-.88).

Academic Stress. The Academic Expectations Stress Inventory (AESI) is a 9-item, 5-point (1 = *never true* to 5 = *almost always true*) Likert-type scale designed to measure the expectations of parents, teachers, and self as a source of academic stress. Higher scores reflect greater perceived academic stress as a result of expectations. In the current study, only the Academic Stress Expectations of Self scale was used in the data analysis.

Ang and Huan (2006) reported internal consistency across the 9-item AESI (the preliminary AESI was a 13-item scale) and the 5-item Expectations of Parents/Teachers and 4-item Expectations of Self subscales, with Cronbach alphas ranging between .74 and .90. In the current study, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was.67 (95% CI = .61-.72) for Academic Stress Expectations of Self Scale.

## Procedure

Participants were recruited from Levels I, II, and III psychology courses. 

They were briefed regarding the study's procedures and allowed to ask questions about their participation in the study. Participants were then administered the survey questionnaires. Following completion of the survey questionnaires, participants were debriefed and given an opportunity to ask any additional questions.

## Results

Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations, are reported in Table 1. Preliminary analyses were performed that checked the data for normality, linearity, univariate and multivariate outliers, missing data, homogeneity of variance, and multicollinearity. Findings indicated that there was 1.43% missing values. No other serious violations were observed. To address the issue of missing data, a regression-based imputation method was used. This procedure was conducted using the Missing Values Analysis module available in SPSS Version 20. Finally, prior to conducting the moderator analysis, scores on the predictor and moderator variables were centered to reduce the potential for multicollinearity 
(Frazier, Tix, & Barron, 2004).

Our main hypotheses were that there would be (a) a positive association between academic stress and mental health symptoms (depression scores and anxiety scores), (b) a negative association between our moderator variables (mindfulness scores and ego resilience scores) and mental health symptoms (depression scores and anxiety scores), and (c) that mindfulness and ego resilience would buffer the positive association between academic stress and mental health symptoms (depression scores and anxiety scores). We tested these hypotheses with a series of four regression analyses with depression and anxiety as dependent variables, academic stress scores as the predictor variable, and mindfulness and ego resilience scores as moderator variables. For these analyses, we entered the predictor variable (academic stress scores) in Step 1, followed by the moderator variable (mindfulness scores or ego resilience scores) in Step 2, followed by the interaction term between the predictor and moderator in Step 3.

Overall, the hypotheses were partially supported. The results from the moderated regression analyses are reported in Tables 2 and 3. In the first model, with mindfulness scores as the moderator variable (see Table 2),

academic stress scores were a positive predictor of both anxiety scores 
(β = .26, p < .001) and depression scores (β = .30, p < .001). Also, scores on the measure of mindfulness were a negative predictor of both anxiety scores (β = −.17, p < .001) and depression scores (β = −.33, p < .001). 

Finally, mindfulness scores buffered the positive association between academic stress scores and scores on the measure of depression (β = −.11, p = 
.010; see Figure 1) but not anxiety scores (β = −.03, p = .558). A simple slopes analysis revealed that the effect of academic stress on depression was higher at low levels of mindfulness (β = .41, p < .001) than at high levels of mindfulness (β = .19, p = .001).

In the second model, with ego resilience scores as the moderator variable 
(see Table 3), academic stress scores were a positive predictor of both anxiety scores (β = .31, p < .001) and depression scores (β = .38, p < .001). Also, scores on the ego resilience measure were a negative predictor of both

## Discussion

The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible moderating effects of two positive psychological constructs, ego resilience and mindfulness, on the association between academic stress and mental health symptoms in a sample of Ghanaian college students. Overall, the hypotheses were partially supported. In our sample of Ghanaian college students, academic stress had a significant positive association with both depression and anxiety. This is consistent with prior research that has shown that academic stress can have negative mental health consequences (Dyrbye et al., 2006; Stoeber & Rambow, 2007). Not only does the current study replicate these findings in a college student sample from Ghana, it also provides an important conceptual extension to this line of inquiry (academic stress) by addressing the crosscultural context. It is anticipated that the study's findings will make a meaningful contribution to the literature in cross-cultural psychology regarding those factors that moderate the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being. In addition to the replication of the association between academic stress and mental health symptoms, this study also explored two positive psychology constructs of interest: ego resilience and mindfulness. Two main findings emerged. First, both ego resilience and mindfulness had significant negative associations with both depression and anxiety. This supports prior research that has found both ego resilience (Klohnen, 1996; Klohnen et al., 1996) and mindfulness (Brown & Ryan, 2003; Caldwell et al., 2010; Schoormans & Nyklicek, 2011) to be negatively associated with mental health symptoms and extends this research by replicating these findings in a sample from Ghana. Second, we found that both ego resilience and mindfulness buffered the association between academic stress and mental health symptoms, albeit in different ways. Ego resilience buffered the association between academic stress and anxiety, whereas mindfulness buffered the association between academic stress and depression.

The differential moderator effects for ego resilience and mindfulness on the relationship between academic stress and mental health symptoms in Ghanaian college students might be interpreted from the conceptual framework of ego psychology. This framework posits that ego control is the ability to regulate (inhibition/expression) one's impulsivity while ego resiliency is the ability to adapt this capacity (ego control) in response to contextual demands (Letzring, Block, & Funder, 2004). According to Block (1993), individuals who are ego resilient tend to be resourceful, easily adapt to new situations, and recover from stress faster. Being that ego resilience moderated the effect of academic stress scores on anxiety, but not depression might be interpreted as a function of ego resilience's role in fostering adaptability in novel situations where anxiety is likely to be high (Block, 2002). The theoretical link that exists between ego resilience and anxiety is not present with depression. As it concerns the moderator effect of mindfulness on the relationship between academic stress and depression, but not anxiety, one hypothesis is that depressive symptoms, which are often caused by a preoccupation with past memories or future worries (Brown & Ryan, 2003), are mitigated by a focus in the here and now. Mindfulness, according to Black (2011), is to be fully engaged (i.e., thoughts, emotions, memories, sensations) with the present moment. Like ego resilience and anxiety, there is arguably a conceptual link between mindfulness and depression.

It may also be important to consider a cultural context as to why our findings indicated that ego resilience and mindfulness functioned to buffer either anxiety or depression, but not both. One cultural explanation might be time orientations. It has been well established that time orientation in African culture is past- and present-oriented (Belgrave & Allison, 2009). According to Jones's (2003) TRIOS model of African worldview and cultural orientation, African time is slow moving and practical. African time is defined by the tasks being performed and events as opposed to dictating what behaviors and events should occur. Furthermore, Jones (2003) asserts that African time is present and past focused as opposed to the future focus of Western time orientation. Therefore, if we were to interpret the study's findings regarding mindfulness in the context of a culture which is present-centered, we might understand the findings to be reflective of the participants' immediate attention to situational stressors. In other words, if mindfulness is about being aware of thoughts and feelings in the moment, could this also lead to an increase in students' awareness of academic situational stressors (e.g., the example of slow internet causing frustration and inefficiency), thereby making mindfulness an ineffective approach for anxiety (Utsey, Hook, Fischer, & Belvet, 2008). Similarly, a present-time orientation might function to facilitate increased adaptive capacity in levels of ego control thereby leading to increased ego resilience.

There were several limitations to the present study. First, the study used a cross-sectional, correlational design. Thus, conclusions about causality should not be made. Although the results are consistent with our theoretical model of academic stress, ego resilience, and mindfulness affecting mental health symptoms, there are other theories that might also explain the data (e.g., depressed individuals are more prone to experience academic stress and less likely to display ego resilience and mindfulness). There may also be other variables not measured in the current study that could have effects on the variables measured in our study, causing a spurious correlation. Second, all the measures used in the present study were self-report, which have several limitations (e.g., response bias). Third, although our sample consisted of a unique population (i.e., Ghanaian college students) and provided an important extension of previous research on these variables, generalizations to older adults or different cultural groups cannot be made with confidence.

There are several exciting areas for future research. Importantly, the present research study provided evidence that the positive psychological constructs of ego resilience and mindfulness were related to lower mental health symptoms and buffered the positive association between academic stress and mental health symptoms. Future research could provide evidence for a causal relationship between these variables. For example, students could be assigned to an intervention designed to promote ego resilience or mindfulness, and the effects could be studied on variables such as academic stress and mental health symptoms. Such research could have important implications for Ghanaian college students, as well as other populations that may be at risk for academic stress and its associated consequences. Also, future research could examine the relationships between these variables in other populations, such as younger children or different cultures that may experience a high level of academic stress.

Academic stress has been found to have a negative effect on mental health, and this relationship may be especially pertinent in populations that experience barriers to a successful educational experience. The current study provides some evidence that interventions aimed to increase ego resilience and mindfulness could be helpful to Ghanaian students. Mindfulness as an intervention for mental health concerns is a relatively new endeavor. A metaanalysis which included 19 studies (Vøllestad, Nielsen, & Nielsen, 2012) 
reviewed mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for patients with diagnoses of anxiety disorders. The authors' results provide evidence that these interventions lead to reductions in anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness interventions generally teach patients how to become aware of their anxiety and practice mindfulness skills to alleviate it. These interventions are being applied more in college settings (Pistorello, 2013) and may also be useful for Ghanaian college students.

In the current study, we examined two positive psychological constructs, ego resilience and mindfulness, and found that these two variables buffered the negative effects of academic stress on mental health in a Ghanaian college student sample. We hope this research will inform future work that explores the role that positive psychology can play in helping buffer the negative mental health effects of stress.
