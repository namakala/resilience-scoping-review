## Abstract

Background: There is a growing evidence that resilience to stress can promote nonsmoking.

However, few studies have undertaken quantitative research to investigate whether resilience, generated by internal and external factors, moderates the impact of stress on the likelihood of smoking. Objective: This study aims to help fill this knowledge gap in relation to smokers and ex-smokers, and those people who have never smoked. Methods: A large online cross-sectional survey was administered in Australia (2015–2016) to collect data on demographic variables, levels of internal and external resilience, and stress from current and past smokers (n ¼ 400) and those who have never-smoked (n ¼ 921). Logistic regressions were employed to test our hypotheses. Results: Most participants were female (82%) and ranged between 18 and 77 years. Higher levels of reported perceived stress and stressrelated variables did significantly predict smoking. The combined impact of internal and external resilience factors predicted never-smoking and lessened the relationship between perceived stress and stress-related variables, and the likelihood of smoking. Conclusion: These results are important because they suggest that the social environment should be developed to augment social support and internal properties such as developing "a strong sense of purpose in life" to encourage people not to commence smoking, rather than focus on smoking cessation.

Resilience and smoking; stress and smoking; internal and external resilience

## Introduction

The literature is replete with empirical evidence that has identified smoking tobacco products as a causal factor for many serious health issues as well as proving to be an enormous financial burden for health systems in Australia and globally, and therefore, does not need to be discussed here (Aune, Schlesinger, Norat, & Ribolli, 2018; Jayes et al., 2016; Lee et al., 1994). The percentage of smokers and nonsmokers in Australia is: Fifteen percent are smokers, 32% are exsmokers, and 53% have never smoked (ABS, 2015).

Several studies have found that resilience to adversity and stress may protect against the risk of ever smoking (Bond, Brough, Spurling, & Hayman, 2012; Lawn et al., 2010; Tsourtos et al., 2011; Ward, Muller, et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2010). Resilience has recently been found by Wang et al. to interact with perceived stress and negative emotions to influence the risk of tobacco use in a sample of Chinese adults (Y. Wang, Chen, Gong, & Yan, 2016). This study was undertaken because tobacco prevention and cessation programs are in need of a greater depth of understanding regarding the mechanism by which factors may interact with each other to influence smoking behavior.

However, much of the previous relevant literature is based on qualitative findings, have not considered the potential for an interaction between internal (psychological domains) and external (social environment)

resilience factors, and have focused on smoking cessation. More quantitative research is required across a broader population to test the hypothesis that people who are resilient to adversity and stress are less likely to smoke, including those who have never smoked.

We aim to build on Wang et al.'s recent findings with a view to developing a critical mass of research evidence that documents the linkages between internal and external resilience factors, stress, and never smoking (Y. Wang et al., 2016).

## Stress

Stress is experienced where the difficulties within the environment exceed the individual's ability to manage these demands (Cardell, 2003; Lobe & DunkelSchetter, 1990). Perceived stress can be related to the level of negative emotional reactivity when exposed to major daily life events and daily stressors (Stawski, Silwinski, Almeida, & Smyth, 2008). A negative emotional experience can be associated with physiological or behavioral changes that may persist beyond the presence of the stressor (Baum, 1990). It has been argued that some people continue to smoke because they believe that smoking can relieve stress (Lawless, Harrison, Grandits, Eberly, & Allen, 2015). Buller et al. found that one of the main reasons why individuals may commence smoking is that they have
"positive attitudes" toward smoking, such as having a belief that smoking reduces stress levels (Buller et al., 2003). The major covariates of stress identified in the literature that can influence smoking status are: Mental health problems, life-threatening events, and financial difficulties (Brugha & Cragg, 1990; Lenthe & Mackenbach, 2006; Reine, Novo, & Hammarstrom, 2004; Siahpush, Borland, & Scollo, 2003; Stead, MacAskill, MacKintosh, Reece, & Eadie, 2001; Tsourtos & O'Dwyer, 2008; Tsourtos et al., 2011; Vogli & Santinello, 2005).

A higher perceived level of stress has been found to be one of the main barriers for smokers not quitting, and others have observed that resilience may influence the relationship between stress and smoking status
(Stead et al., 2001; Tsourtos & O'Dwyer, 2008; Tsourtos, Ward, & Muller, 2008; Tsourtos et al., 2011; Y. Wang et al., 2016). For example, in addition to Wang et al.'s quantitative study that investigated the relationships between smoking, resilience, and stress,
(mentioned earlier) Tsourtos et al.'s (2011) qualitative study included an ex-smoker participant, medically diagnosed with major depression, who was able to maintain her nonsmoking status when she perceived higher levels of stress in her life (downtimes) by employing certain resilience strategies. Prior to developing these strategies, this participant reported smoking more when stress levels were perceived to increase. However, more research is required to provide evidence that there is an important interplay between resilience, stress, and smoking, which is the aim of our study.

## Resilience Defined & The Psychosocial Interactive Model Of Resilience

Luthar et al. have defined resilience as positive adaptation by individuals in the face of adversity (Luthar, Cichetti, & Becker, 2000). Resilience is likely to be built over time and is influenced by the external social context, as well as an individual's internal cognitive and emotional state (Luthar et al., 2000). Authors, including Ungar, have also emphasized the importance of both internal and external factors in the development and maintenance of resilience (Ungar, 2004).

Resilience has been defined as recovering or
"bouncing back" from adversity and gaining the ability to confront hardship whereby hope, meaning, and optimism are also gained (Deveson, 2003; Windle, 2011). A recent and comprehensive definition of resilience has been conceptualized by Ward et al. (p.

2) as: "the interaction between the internal properties of the individual, and the set of external conditions, that allow individual adaptation, or resistance, to different forms of adversity at different points in the lifecourse" (Ward, Muller, et al., 2011). This definition relates to the psycho-social interactive model of resilience, which unlike much of the previous literature, proposes that both internal psychological properties (internal resilience) and external social environmental factors (external resilience) be considered over one's life-course because both are likely to be important in predicting outcomes, particularly in response to adversity (Tsourtos et al., 2011, 2015; Ward, Muller, et al.,
2011). This model also places an emphasis on the interactions between an individual's internal psychological states (e.g., self-esteem, motivation, etc.) and their external social environment (e.g., peer and family support) whereby resources and assets can be utilized in response to unfavorable stressful circumstances (Dowrick, Kokanovic, & Hegary, 2008; Tsourtos et al., 2011; Ward, Muller, et al., 2011).

Ward's psychosocial interactive model of resilience has been applied to smoking and suggests that where people are placed in a context where the risk of smoking is great, internal resilience together with external resilience will discriminate those who initiate and those who reject the behavior (Ward, Muller, et al., 2011). This model has been employed as a theoretical framework in regard to understanding why individuals do not smoke (ex-smokers and never-smokers) despite living in populations where there is a high-smoking prevalence (Tsourtos et al., 2011; Ward, Muller, et al., 2011), and where perceived stress levels maybe high (Tsourtos et al., 2011).

Consistent with the definition proposed by Ward et al., Lindstrom et al. have argued that it is important to consider social factors when conceptualizing external resilience and its impact on health-related behaviors, including smoking status (Elmstahl, Isacsson, &
Lindstrom, 2003; Ward, Muller, et al., 2011). Authors such as Pinkerton & Dolan discuss how external resilience in the way of formal family support interventions can also be linked to coping with adversity and stress (Pinkerton & Dolan, 2007). Resilience can be built when social relationships and networks allow access to resources and assets, such as social support, that can help an individual manage or "bounce back" from adverse experiences (Elmstahl et al., 2003; Lawn et al., 2010; Ledogar & Fleming, 2008; Patterson, Eberly, Ding, & Hargreaves, 2004; Sapag, Poblete, & Eicher, 2010; Ungar, 2004; Ward, Muller, et al., 2011). Social support has been found to increase smoking abstinence (Murray, Johnstone, Doice, Lee, & O'Hara, 1995). Lawn et al. have described external resilience as rising from strong social connections (also called social capital) that can provide important support networks to counter adversity and stress and thereby assist people to reject smoking (including those people who have never initiated smoking) (Lawn et al., 2010).

Meyer and Ward have developed a relatively new conceptual framework known as social quality theory that integrates and measures several of the dimensions related to social capital and social support that are likely to define the external influences on resilience (Meyer, Luong, Ward, & Tsourtos, 2010; Ward, Meyer, Verity, Gill, & Luong, 2011). They operationalized four external social domains: Social cohesion
(defined by Ward et al., p. 2 as the "extent to which people and groups share social norms and values, and to issues of solidarity and trust"); social inclusion
(related to equal value and the integration into social relations); social empowerment (related to human dignity and where personal abilities are augmented by social relations); and socioeconomic security (related to social justice and the protection from poverty) (Meyer et al., 2010; Ward, Meyer, et al., 2011). Wang discusses how these domains can be used to measure resilience, arising from external factors, in terms of
"the extent to which people are able to participate in social relationships under conditions which enhance their well-being, capacity and individual potential" (p.

1) (X. Wang, 2016).

In the context of not smoking, it is likely that both internal and external resilience factors will ameliorate perceived stress levels and thereby decrease the likelihood of smoking, because there is less need to rely on smoking as a coping mechanism. However, few studies have undertaken quantitative research to investigate whether resilience, generated by internal and external factors, moderates the impact of stress on the likelihood of smoking.

## Hypotheses

Using the Ward et al. model of resilience formation, (Ward, Muller, et al., 2011) we have quantitatively investigated the relationship between internal and external resilience, stress, and their association with never smoking in order to test the hypothesis that higher levels of resilience will be evident among people who have never smoked, and will moderate the impact of stress on the likelihood of smoking. That is, higher levels of resilience will ameliorate perceived levels of stress and thereby decrease the likelihood of smoking.

We specifically examined if: (1) higher levels of stress or stress-related variables will be associated with smoking; and (2) higher levels of total resilience, measured by combining external and internal resilience, will be reported by people who have never smoked, and will moderate the relationship between stress or stress-related variables and smoking.

## Methods Research Design

We undertook an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey in Australia. A quantitative methodology was deemed most appropriate for this study in which we aimed to recruit a large sample of more than a thousand participants (Saks & Allsop, 2007), to ensure a wide range of adversities, levels of stress experienced, and levels of resilience were represented.

## Target Population & Recruitment

The sample of Australian adults was recruited through a diverse range of online and offline advertising from the following smoking status groups: Those who currently smoked (regularly smoked for at least the past 2 years), ex-smokers (not smoked in the past 3 or more months but previously regularly smoked), and those who had never smoked.

Following ethics approval from the Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee at Flinders University (approval number 6,760) participant recruitment was conducted for the online questionnaire survey by advertising the online survey via social media and University web pages. Flyers and posters were distributed on Flinders University campus. Further recruitment was made via: Not for profit organizations (QuitSA and Asthma Foundation SA),
and SA Health web sites and newsletters. An advertisement was also posted in community newspapers distributed across the South Australian metropolitan area. Each participant was offered the opportunity to go into a draw to win one of twelve $25 Westfield shopping vouchers to thank them for taking the time to participate. The online survey was open between late 2015 and April 2016. The final sample size was 1,321 and the majority were South Australian (94%). The remaining 6% were recruited across the other Australian states and territories.

## Measures

The online questionnaire was developed using Qualtrics Survey software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, 2015). The first section contained the information sheet, followed by demographic and background questions regarding: smoking status (never-smokers, exsmoker, or current smoker), age, gender, level of education, quit attempts, cessation duration, general health (Overall, how would you rate your general health?), and diagnosed mental health conditions (Has a doctor ever told you that you might have a mental health problem? A yes/no response was required). Postcodes were used to calculate the Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA) to give a broad overview of the participants' socioeconomic status. SEIFA is a measure used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to rank communities in Australia based on their socioeconomic status (SES). The higher the decile score is, the higher the SES will be.

The hypotheses were tested using the following validated measures:

## Internal Resilience

This was measured with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) (Connor & Davidson, 2003). The CD-RISC measures "the personal qualities that enable an individual to thrive in the face of adversity" (Connor & Davidson, 2003) (p. 76). Recent studies, such as the one undertaken by Goldstein et al., have used the Connor-Davidson validated scale to measure levels of internal resilience that protects against negative outcomes for smoking and alcohol use (Connor & Davidson, 2003; Goldstein, Faulkner,
& Wekerie, 2013). Responses to this 25-item instrument are scored on a 5-point scale (0–4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. This scale has been shown as having good discriminant validity with significant differences in average levels of resilience between those in community groups, including: Those with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders, those experiencing generalized anxiety, psychiatric outpatients, and primary care patients by comparison with the US general population (Connor & Davidson, 2003). It is important to note that the scale has also been normed on a large scale Australian community cohort
(n ¼ 5,780) aged between 28 and 72 years (Liu, Fairweather-Schmidt, Burns, & Roberts, 2015).

## External Resilience

Several markers of external resilience were used. These consisted of eight questions from four Social Quality Theory domains and the ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (ESSI). The four social quality domains were measured using key questions from the validated social quality questionnaire: Social cohesion [the extent to which the respondents were happy with the social situation (5 point scale where a low score represented being very happy), was a member of a community group or club (e.g., sporting club; member
¼1, non-member ¼2)]; social inclusion [rating importance of belonging to family, neighborhood, city or town (5 point scale where low score represented being very important)]; social empowerment [asked to respond yes or no regarding—most people would take advantage of you, most people can be trusted]; and socioeconomic security [asked if living with someone or alone (if reported living with someone the response also required to specify who)] (Meyer et al., 2010; Ward, Meyer, et al., 2011). Meyer found the social quality questionnaire reliable after using both testretest and inter-item reliability analyses in Australia
(Meyer et al., 2010). Social support availability was measured using a component from the ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (Ozbay et al., 2007), (Vaglio et al., 2004). The ESSI was found to be a valid and reliable measure of social support in patients undergoing treatment for coronary artery disease
(n ¼ 271) (Vaglio et al., 2004). Six items from ESSI
were used, where a higher score represents more social support availability (Vaglio et al., 2004). The 7th item (are you currently married or living with a partner?) was not used because a similar question was asked elsewhere in the survey. This instrument was chosen because it has been validated and is brief, thus, encouraging a high-response rate.

## Stress

Cohen's 10-item Global Measure of Perceived Stress was used (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). This instrument has been validated for measuring stress with smoker populations and uses a 5-point scale (0–4) regarding how often did the respondents experience stress-related "feelings" in the last 30 days
(Leung, Lam, & Chan, 2010). A score of 20 or more on Cohen's index represents "high" levels of stress
(Cohen et al., 1983). Three stress covariates were also measured. These specific measures relate to the major covariates of stress identified in the literature that can influence smoking status (mentioned earlier). These measures were: The List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire (LTE-Q), a validated measure that asks questions about the number of stressful life events experienced in the past 12 months (Brugha & Cragg, 1990). Respondents were also asked if they had a diagnosis of mental health problems. Lastly, they were asked about their level of income and any difficulties they experienced in managing this. Using the LTE-Q,
in addition to Cohen's perceived stress scale to measure stress in regard to smoking status was recently recommended by Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2016).

## Data Analysis

All questionnaire items were pre-coded and data were analyzed using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) and IBM SPSS (version 22). Continuous variables are described using the median (inter-quartile range), and categorical variables are described using frequency (percentage). Following descriptive statistical analysis (used to establish measures of central tendency, data entry accuracy, and parametric test assumptions, etc.)
bivariate analyses were undertaken using p - .05 to determine which variables would be entered as independent variables in the multivariate regression analyses. Differences in subject characteristics between smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis tests for continuous variables and Cramer's V for categorical variables.

Stress was assessed using three separate measures; Cohen's perceived stress score, the number of lifethreatening events (LTE), and level of perceived difficulty in managing income (Easy/Not too bad/
Sometimes difficult/Always difficult). Internal and external resilience were both coded as 0, 1, or 2 according to tertiles of the Connor-Davidson score and the ESSI instrument. As the modifying effects of these two factors were very similar (see Supplementary Figures 1a and 1b), we combined them into a total resilience score (range 0–4), which was calculated as the sum of internal and external resilience scores. The association between our outcome of interest, smoking, and our exposure variable of interest, stress, was examined using binary logistic regression with smoking measured as a dichotomized variable (ever smoked versus never smoked). Both unadjusted estimates for stress were obtained and also those with adjustment for age, level of education
(1–5), gender, whether born overseas, income, and SEIFA score. We also examined the modifying impact of resilience (Internal and External) on the association between smoking and stress by including a stress X
total resilience interaction term in the logistic regression models. Following model estimation, we obtained the predicted (marginal) probabilities of smoking according to each stress variable and level of total resilience. These were plotted as line graphs to show the modifying effect of total resilience on the association between stress and the probability of smoking.

We also assessed the independent associations with smoking for the eight separate questions relating to Social Quality (unhappy with social situation, not belonging to clubs and community groups, the importance of family, importance of neighborhood, importance of being in a city or town, whether people take advantage of me, whether people can be trusted, and whether or not living alone). As there were only eight questions employed to measure four social quality domains, our instrument could not be analyzed reliably by these subscales. We, therefore, instead assessed the independent predictive value of these eight items by assessing them in the three multivariate models that examine smoking, stress, and resilience. These eight variables were added separately and then together (if still significant at p < .05) to each of the three adjusted models (with stress measured using either perceived stress score, LTE, or managing income), and their effect sizes and statistical significance were assessed. Finally, we added a binary indicator for mental health (ever been told by your doctor you have a mental health problem) to each of the three models to assess its independent association with smoking status.

The goodness of fit for each model was assessed using McFadden's R-squared.

## Results

There were 163 (12%) current smokers, 237 (18%) exsmokers, and 921 (70%) who had never smoked. The percentage of smokers and nonsmokers in Australia is: Fifteen percent are likely to be smokers, 32% are likely to be ex-smokers, and 53% never smokers (ABS, 2015); suggesting our population contained relatively fewer ex-smokers and relatively more never smokers. Therefore, some caution might be required when assessing the generalizability of our findings. The majority of participants completing the online survey were female (n ¼ 1081, 82%). Participants ranged between 18 and 77 years of age (median ¼25.0 years of age). More information about background participant characteristics for each of the smoking status groups is provided in Table 1. A greater percentage of smokers rated their general health moderate to poor compared to ex-smokers and never-smokers. Ex-smokers were

significantly older. The majority of current smokers had made at least one attempt to quit smoking but there was no significant difference in the level of education (number of participants with less than a tertiary education) between the three smoking status groups.

Bivariate analyses showed that the external resiliencerelated variables were significantly different between smoking status groups (p- .05), see Table 1. Since Tukey post-hoc tests revealed no significant difference in the mean internal resilience scores of smokers and ex-smokers, we combined current smokers and exsmoker participants into one category (smokers group)
and those who never smoked into the other for further hypothesis testing. Post-hoc tests also revealed no significant difference between smokers and ex-smokers for other variables listed in Table 1 except for ESSI and age, but age was controlled for in subsequent analyses.

## Association Between Stress, Resilience, And Smoking

The following tables (Tables 2–4) present the inferential statistical results related to the hypotheses.

## Perceived Stress Score, Total Resilience, And Probability Of Smoking

The results of the binary logistic regression analysis examining the association between the perceived stress score and the odds of being a current or ex-smoker are presented in Table 2. In those with the lowest levels of resilience (i.e.,
total resilience ¼0), there was a 6.4% increase in the odds of smoking for each unit increase in the stress score after adjustment (OR ¼1.064; 95% CI ¼1.051, 1.076). There was, however, a significant overall modifying effect of total resilience (p< .05 for stress score X total resilience interaction) (Figure 2a). The effect of the stress score on increasing the odds of smoking was significant for those with a total resilience score of 1 (p< .05) or 2 (p< .05) but was not significant for those with a total resilience score of 3 or 4 (Figure 2a and Table 2).

## Life-Threatening Events, Total Resilience, And Probability Of Smoking

The results of the binary logistic regression analysis examining the association between the number of life-threatening events (LTE) and the odds of being a current or exsmoker are presented in Table 2. In those with the lowest levels of resilience (i.e., total resilience ¼0), there was a 26% increase in the odds of smoking for each additional LTE encountered after adjustment (OR ¼1.26; 95% CI
¼1.09, 1.45). For those with a total resilience of 1, the association between increasing numbers of LTE increasing the odds of smoking was also significant (OR ¼1.249; 95% CI
¼1.081, 1.443). In contrast, there was no significant association between the number of LTEs and smoking in those with a total resilience score of 2, 3, or 4. However, the overall modifying effect of total resilience was not significant
(p> .05 for LTE X total resilience interaction) (Figure 2b).

When the interaction term was removed from the adjusted model, the odds of smoking increased by 16.1% for each additional LTE (OR ¼1.16, 95% CI ¼1.08, 1.23; p< .05).

In addition, compared to those with a total resilience of 0, the odds of smoking were 0.84 (p > .05), 0.60 (p< .05), 0.43 (p< .05) and 0.51 (p< .05) for those with a total resilience of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

The overall modifying effect of total resilience on managing income was also not significant (p > .05 for managing income X total resilience interaction) (Figure 2c).

Compared to those that found managing income easy, the odds of smoking were 1.46 (p > .05), 1.86 (p < .05), and 3.26 (p < .05) for those that found managing income not too bad, difficult sometimes, and difficult always respectively. There was also an overall effect of resilience on the probability of smoking (p < .05) within this model. Compared to those with a total resilience of 0, the odds of smoking were 0.79 (p > .05), 0.57 (p < .05), 0.44 (p < 0.05), and 0.51 (p < 0.05) for those with a total resilience of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

## Influence Of Social Quality Factors And Mental Health

When the Social Quality variables were added to each of the fully adjusted models, there were independent associations with smoking status for three of the eight questions. The likelihood of smoking was associated with (a) being unhappy with my social situation (model included LTEs), and (b) not belonging to clubs and community groups. The likelihood of never smoking was associated with (c) the importance of

family. The effect estimates for these indicators were similar for the three models that included either perceived stress score, number of LTE or managing income as the stress exposure variable (Table 4). Factors that did not independently predict smoking status were; importance of neighborhood, importance of being in a city or town, whether people take advantage of me, whether people can be trusted, and whether or not living alone.

Having ever been diagnosed by your doctor as having a mental health problem was also independently associated with smoking status in each of the three models with stress score, LTE and managing income (OR ¼2.45, 2.51, and 2.45 respectively; p < .05 for each). That is, the variable mental health problem was significantly associated with increasing the likelihood of smoking. When the variables happiness with social situation, belonging to a club/
community group, importance of family, and mental health diagnosis, were added to the model that included the perceived stress variable, the stress score X Total resilience interaction changed from being significant (p < .05) to being non-significant
(p > .05). The McFadden's pseudo-r-squared for the three stress models ranged from 0.1597 to 0.1678, indicating a similar fit for each model that were approximately 16% better than an interceptonly model.

## Discussion

Our findings largely supported hypothesis 1: Higher perceived stress scores and stress-related variables were found to be significantly associated with smoking. In addition, our data supports our second hypothesis that resilience modifies the association between smoking and stress. Specifically, perceived stress and the stress-related variable LTE were associated with an increased likelihood of smoking when resilience was low but not otherwise. When the interaction term was removed for the adjusted LTE model
(Table 2), the odds of smoking increased for each additional LTE. When the interaction term was removed from model 3 (Table 3), there was a significant overall effect of managing income increasing the likelihood of smoking. The variable mental health problems was also independently associated with increasing the odds of smoking.

Total resilience (Connor Davidson's internal resilience and ESSI external resilience) significantly modified the important relationship between Cohen's perceived stress score and smoking. A strength of this finding is that Cohen's measure has been validated as an index of stress for smokers, thus, making it a good measure of stress to examine the association with smoking. There was also some evidence that the stress-related variable LTE no longer encouraged smoking where resilience levels were higher although the relationship was not significant. However, for both the LTE and managing income models resilience was significantly related to a decrease in the likelihood of smoking after the interaction term was removed, supporting our first hypothesis. It is interesting to note that the two stress variables (Cohen's perceived stress and LTE) that Wang et al. (2016) recommended in relation to examining levels of resilience demonstrated the strongest support for hypothesis 2. The stressrelated question of mental health problems (ever been told by your doctor you have a mental health problem) may not represent a valid measure of stress in relation to smoking status and resilience and there may be some degree of measurement error since this question did not ask participants at what period in their life and the extent to which they were suffering from mental ill-health. There was some evidence that social quality (also representing external resilience) is related to not smoking with three of the eight social quality variables that were added to the models found to independently predict never smoking: Belonging to clubs and community groups, being happy with my social situation, and placing an importance of family all predicted never smoking. However, when they were added with the mental health variable to the model that included the perceived stress variable, the stress score X Total resilience interaction effect changed from being significant to being non-significant. This would support the possibility that whilst social quality may act independently on stress, it may also mediate some of the effects of resilience.

In another recent study, authors have suggested three underlying mechanisms that connect external resilience to health-related behaviors like smoking, where there can be a significant reduction in the likelihood of being a smoker (Alcala, Sharif, & Albert, 2016). First, that it is associated with augmenting social support where there can be an increase in emotional or functional aid from family and friends, and can assist at the cognitive level, such as increasing self-efficacy. Our study did find evidence found that social support (ESSI; ENRICHD Social Support) combined with internal resilience was a significant explanatory external resilience factor for smoking status. Second, higher levels of social cohesion (one of the four social quality domains) can endorse socialization to neighborhood norms (although this can also promote smoking as well as reduce it). Our study found two social cohesion-related questions were associated with never smoking. Third, they argue that external resilience can "buffer" (p. 202) against stress being a risk factor for smoking. Wang et al. have recently reported that increasing levels of resilience is a more effective approach for encouraging people not to smoke than focusing on stress management programs, which have often been found to fail (Wang et al., 2016). Our study found that Cohen's perceived stress score and the three stress covariates (LTE, mental health problems, and difficulties with managing income) did significantly predict smoking and there was evidence that resilience weakened the impact of perceived stress and increasing the likelihood of smoking.

Our findings are important because the literature mostly focuses on stress acting as a barrier for smokers to quit, whereas our investigation had an emphasis on preventing the commencement of this risk behavior. There is increasing evidence from our study and previous published works to endorse the development of a resilience intervention to prevent people from taking up smoking (Lawn et al., 2010; Ward, Muller, et al., 2011). Our findings that total resilience and some of the social quality-related variables are associated with never having smoked highlighted the importance of encouraging and promoting internal and external resilience in terms of coping with and bouncing back from adversity in relation to smoking. Establishing quantifiable strong links between resilience and never smoking encourages an assets-based approach that focuses on the strengths, abilities, resources, knowledge, and capacities of individuals (Bartley, Schoon, & Mitchell, 2006).

Encouraging social environments where resilience can be promoted is commensurate with one of the Australian National Tobacco Strategy (2012–2018)
priority areas, to prevent social isolation that is often associated with the uptake of high-risk behaviors, such as smoking (Commonwealth Government of Australia, 2012).

## Limitations

Previous research has reported that ex-smokers are more likely to be internally resilient than smokers (Tsourtos et al., 2011, 2015; Ward, Muller, et al.,
2011), but our results did not find a significant difference in the mean level of internal resilience between ex-smokers and current smokers. This may have been due to a reduced sensitivity in our measure of internal resilience (CD-RISC). A recent study has reported that the CD-RISC instrument is a valid instrument but suffers from a "ceiling effect," that it is not reliable in assessing for high levels of resilience
(Gonzalez, Sierra, Martinez-Molina, & Ponce, 2015). Six of the seven items in the ESSI instrument were used, which may have diminished the validity of this measure. However, Vaglio et al. (2004) found that the item we removed contributed least to this instrument's validity. Our sample contained a large proportion of female participants, which could restrict our ability to generalize our results. Nonetheless, our analyses did control for gender. The cross-sectional design of our study limits our ability to identify the direction of the variables under investigation. For example, we cannot say with certainty that smoking did not contribute to levels of stress experienced. Our analysis has, however, identified strong predictors of smoking status that could inform future preventive practice. For ex-smokers, the survey measurement of perceived stress in their lives may not necessarily reflect the level of perceived stress at the time they were smoking (shown in Table 1 to be on average 8 years ago), which presents as a possible time-varying confounding factor. If the recorded level of stress at the time of the survey is lower than when they were smoking, and an association between stress and smoking does exist, then our observed association between stress and smoking will have been underestimated. Conversely, if the level of stress was higher at the time of the survey than when they were smoking then we may have overestimated the association.

The results from our study indicate that internal and external resilience do play a role in smoking and that it moderates the relationship between perceived stress and smoking. This is important because it highlights the need to invest in a social environment that can help promote social support and encourage internal properties (e.g., having a strong sense of purpose in life) that can prevent the uptake of smoking, rather than focusing on approaches such as stress management for smoking cessation. While these results are likely to have implications for developed countries that are similar to Australia, an international comparative study would be useful.
