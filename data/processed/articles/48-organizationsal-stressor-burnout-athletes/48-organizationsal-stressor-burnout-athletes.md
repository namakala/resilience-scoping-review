## 29 **Abstract**

30 We present two studies examining the extent to which the frequency of organizational 31 stressors encountered relate to burnout and whether psychological resilience qualities moderate any 32 such relationship. The studies were conducted with independent samples of athletes and coaches 33 using a questionnaire design. In study one, 372 athletes completed measures of organizational 34 stressors (OSI-SP), resilience (CD-RISC-10), and burnout (Athlete Burnout Questionnaire). In 35 study two, 91 coaches completed measures of organizational stressors (OSI-SP), resilience (CD- 36 RISC-10), and burnout (Coach Burnout Questionnaire). Data were analyzed in a moderated 37 regression model using Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS and supported the hypotheses that 38 organizational stressor frequency was directly related to burnout in both athletes and coaches and 39 that psychological resilience moderated this relationship. These results highlight the influential role 40 of organizational dynamics for athlete and coach well-being and indicate that psychological 41 resilience is a salient individual difference variable that buffers against potential negative outcomes. 42 *Keywords*: coaching, PROCESS, resilient, sport, stress, well-being 43 44 Psychological Resilience Moderates the Relationship between the Frequency of Organizational 45 Stressors and Burnout in Athletes and Coaches 46 Participation in competitive sport is typically characterized by a wide range of demands 47 that could lead to a disruption in performance and impaired health and well-being (Fletcher & 48 Arnold, 2017). One category of demands that are particularly prevalent and problematic for 49 athletes are those associated with the organization within which they operate (see Arnold & 50 Fletcher, 2012; Fletcher, Hanton, & Mellalieu, 2006). With regards to the prevalence of these 51 demands, sport performers have been found to experience and recall more organizational stressors 52 than those associated with competitive performances (Hanton, Fletcher & Coughlin, 2005). In 53 terms of their problematic nature, scholars have argued that the presence of organizational 54 stressors in sport might be inevitable (e.g., Fletcher et al., 2006), largely uncontrollable (Hanton, 55 Wagstaff & Fletcher, 2012), and give rise to a variety of emotional, behavioral, and attitudinal 56 responses (Fletcher, Wagstaff, & Hanton, 2012). Such responses may have diverse consequences 57 for burnout (Tabei, Fletcher & Goodger, 2012), dissatisfaction (Noblet, Rodwell & McWilliams, 58 2003), negative emotions (Fletcher et al., 2012), and impaired preparation for and performance in 59 major competitions (Gould, Guinan, Greenleaf, Mudberry & Peterson, 1999). To this end, we 60 report the findings from two studies. The first aim of these studies was to ascertain whether the 61 frequency of organizational stressors encountered by athletes and coaches was related to burnout 62 dimensions. The second aim was of this research was to establish whether psychological 63 resilience qualities moderated the relationship between the frequency of organizational stressors 64 and burnout. 65 Much of the extant research on organizational stress in sport has been conceptually aligned 66 with transactional theory (see Lazarus, 1999), of which the main tenet is that stress resides neither 67 in the person or their environment, but transaction between the two. In line with this theoretical 68 foundation, Fletcher et al. (2006) defined organizational stress in sport as, "an ongoing transaction 69 between an individual and the environmental demands associated primarily and directly with the 70 organization within which he or she is operating" (p. 329; adapted from Woodman & Hardy, 71 2001). In keeping with Fletcher et al.'s (2006) definition of organizational stress, researchers have 72 sought to identify and examine the types of organizational stressors encountered by individuals in 73 sport (e.g., Arnold, Fletcher, & Daniels, 2016, 2017; Fletcher, Hanton, Mellalieu, & Neil, 2012; 74 Kristiansen, Murphy & Roberts, 2012; Woodman & Hardy, 2001). Arnold and Fletcher (2012) 75 conducted a research synthesis and developed a taxonomy of organizational stressors in sport 76 comprising four categories. To elaborate, leadership and personnel issues (e.g., coach's 77 personality and external expectations), cultural and team issues (e.g., communication and goal 78 setting), logistical and environmental issues (e.g., travel and accommodation), and performance 79 and personal issues (e.g., injury and finances) were identified as organizational stressors. This 80 classification provided the conceptual foundation for the development and validation of the 81 Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sport Performers (OSI-SP; Arnold et al., 2013). 82 Although research investigating organizational stress in competitive sport has advanced 83 considerably over the past decade, much work remains to be done. For instance, most of the 84 studies to date have focused on one component (e.g., stressors, appraisal, responses, coping, 85 outcomes) of the organizational stress process in sport performers. Hence, it is important that 86 researchers progress beyond investigating discrete aspects of the organizational stress process 87 (e.g., stressors, appraisals, responses, coping) in performers alone, and explore links between 88 components of the process (e.g., factors relevant to the stress-burnout relationship) across a more 89 diverse range of stakeholders within organizational spheres (Fletcher & Arnold, 2017).

90 **Burnout in Competitive Sport**
91 The importance of investigating burnout within sport organizations stems from the 92 detrimental impact it can have on health, well-being, and performance. Indeed, burnout has been 93 associated with negative affective, cognitive, motivational, and behavioural consequences such as 94 decreased performance, overtraining, reduced sense of accomplishment, depressed mood, feelings 95 of helplessness, diminished motivation and eventual withdrawal from sport (Cresswell & Eklund, 96 2006b; Goodger, Gorely, Lavallee & Harwood, 2007; Gustafsson Hassmén, Kenttä & Johansson, 97 2008; Gustafsson, Kenttä & Hassmén, 2011). Extant research has generally supported a link 98 between stressors and burnout (for reviews see e.g., Cresswell & Eklund, 2006b; Gustafsson et 99 al., 2011). Nevertheless, while we agree that stress is an important component of the burnout 100 process, not everyone who experiences stress burns out (Raedeke, 1997). Further, we concur with 101 Coakley (1992) among others (e.g., Cresswell & Eklund, 2006b, Goodger, Wolfenden & 102 Lavallee, 2007; Gould et al., 1996) that the organization of sport can create climates associated 103 with higher incidences of burnout. 104 **Athlete burnout.** While there has been some conceptual debate among scholars (cf. 105 Cresswell & Eklund, 2006a; Goodger, Gorely, Lavallee & Harwood, 2007), it is generally 106 accepted that athlete burnout is an experiential condition characterized by symptoms of physical 107 and emotional exhaustion, reduced sense of accomplishment, and devaluation of the sporting 108 context (Raedeke, 1997; Raedeke & Smith, 2009). According to Raedeke and colleagues 109 (Raedeke, 1997; Raedeke, Lunney & Venables, 2002), physical and emotional exhaustion (PEE) 110 emanates from the psychosocial and physical demands associated with intense training and 111 competition. Reduced sense of accomplishment (RA) refers to feelings of inefficacy and the 112 tendency to evaluate oneself negatively in terms of performance and ability. Sport devaluation 113 (DV) is a negative, detached attitude toward sport reflected in part by a lack of concern for 114 performance quality. Research has examined the stressor-burnout relationship in athletes. For 115 example, Gould, Udry, Tuffey and Loehr (1997) reported factors such as increased pressure from 116 others and the need for a social life as contributing to athlete burnout. Further qualitative research 117 by Gustafsson et al. (2008) found situational and organizational factors (e.g., work/school 118 demands, logistical concerns, a lack of social support) to be associated with burnout in elite 119 athletes. Such findings imply the numerous environmental demands that athletes face might lead 120 to debilitating personal and professional effects. 121 **Coach burnout.** Conceptualizations of coach burnout have similarity with athlete burnout 122 but with researchers devoting greater attention to the coaching *context* (Kelley, 1994). 123 Consequently, much of the extant coach burnout literature has investigated the relationship 124 between personal (e.g., gender, age) and situational (e.g., work overload, social support) factors STRESSORS, RESILIENCE AND BURNOUT 6 125 with the three general burnout dimensions allied with athlete burnout (viz. PEE, RA, and DV; 126 Georgios & Nikolaos, 2012; Kelley, Eklund & Ritter-Taylor, 1999). To elaborate, a lack of 127 perceived autonomy and control (Vealey, Udry, Zimmerman & Soliday, 1992), and role 128 ambiguity and role conflicts (Capel, Sisley & Desertrain, 1987), have been linked to coach 129 burnout. Recently, Lundkvist, Gustafsson, Hjalm and Hassmén (2012) provided a qualitative 130 perspective of burnout in elite soccer coaches. Lundkvist et al.'s findings illustrate coach burnout 131 as stemming from a combination of issues relating to the performance environment profile (e.g., 132 outside pressure to perform, problems handling the performance environment), and the life 133 situation profile (e.g., workload, family, health issues), many of which have relation to 134 organizational stressors. 135 H1. The frequency with which organizational stressors are encountered is positively related to 136 burnout in a) athletes and b) coaches.

137 **Psychological Resilience in Competitive Sport** 
138 As alluded to above, while it would appear that stressors are an important component of 139 the burnout process, not all individuals who experience stress will burnout or withdraw from sport 140 (Raedeke, 1997). Therefore, to better understand why individuals report different outcomes to 141 similar organizational stressors, research might examine the role of potential moderating and 142 mediating variables, including various cognitive, emotional, and attitudinal, and individual 143 differences phenomena. Psychological resilience is one important individual difference in sport 144 organizations as those operating within them must use a variety of protective factors to withstand 145 stressors (Fletcher & Sarkar, 2012). Early resilience research in competitive sport focused on 146 athletes' responses to adversity (Galli & Vealey, 2008; Martin-Kruum, Sarrazin, Peterson & 147 Famose, 2003; Mummery, Schofield, & Perry, 2004) and the delivery of training programs to 148 develop resilience (Schinke & Jerome, 2002; Schinke, Peterson, & Couture, 2004). In a more 149 recent and systematic program of research, Fletcher and Sarkar defined psychological resilience 150 as, "the role of mental processes and behavior in promoting personal assets and protecting an 151 individual from the potential negative effect of stressors" (2012, p. 675; 2013, p. 16). This 152 definition emphasizes the potentially negative effects of stressors and the need to maintain mental 153 and behavioral functioning in the face of adversity (Sarkar & Fletcher, 2014). 154 In an interview study with 12 Olympic champions, Fletcher and Sarkar (2012) found that 155 participants encountered a wide variety of stressors and possessed five main psychological 156 protective factors (relating to a positive personality, motivation, confidence, focus, and perceived 157 social support) that underpin the resilience-stress-performance relationship. Further to this, Sarkar 158 and Fletcher (2014) reviewed the different types of stressors (viz. competitive, organizational and 159 personal) encountered by sport performers and found the aforementioned psychological protective 160 factors appear to protect athletes from the potentially negative effect of these stressors. Such 161 findings suggest psychological resilience buffers against potentially negative responses to 162 organizational stressors in athletes. 163 **H2.** The frequency with which the organizational stressors encountered by a) athletes and b) 164 coaches interacts with psychological resilience to predict burnout, whereby, as psychological 165 resilience qualities increase, there would be a significantly weaker relationship between the 166 frequency of organizational stressors and burnout.

167 **Purpose of the Studies**
168 From the preceding review, it would appear that psychological resilience is a potentially 169 salient asset for those who operate in demanding sport environments (i.e., athletes and coaches). 170 Hence, it seems pertinent to examine resilience in the organizational stressor-burnout relationship 171 given the recent calls for researchers to examine the role of potential moderating and mediating 172 variables in the organizational stress process in sport (cf. Fletcher & Arnold, 2017). In light of 173 these observations, the aim of this research was to ascertain whether organizational stressor 174 frequency was related to burnout and whether psychological resilience qualities moderated any 175 such relationship in athletes and coaches. 176 **Study 1** 177 **Method** 178 Participants 179 For the purpose of this study, 372 athletes were recruited from a large range of sports (n = 180 43). Participants from individual (e.g., golf, archery and equestrian), team (e.g., basketball, 181 football, rugby) and combined individual and team (e.g., cycling, tennis and rowing) sports were 182 recruited. Males comprised the majority of the sample (57.8%) and the participants ranged in age 183 from 17 to 42 years (M = 21, SD = 5.91). On average, athletes had 8.77 hours per week (SD = 184 5.70) of active involvement in training and competition and had competed for their current 185 organization for 5.1 years (SD = 4.43). At the time of the study, participants performed at club (n 186 = 138), county (n = 103), regional (n = 49), national (n = 52) and international (n = 30) level. 187 Following institutional ethical approval, participants were recruited via opportunity sampling and 188 online distribution using web-based Typeform software. The sampling criteria specified that 189 participants had to be aged over 16 years and be current athletes in a sport organization. 

190 **Procedure**
191 The data collection process involved distribution of a questionnaire pack that included the 192 Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sports Performers (OSI-SP; Arnold, Fletcher & Daniels, 193 2013), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10; Campbell-Sills & Stein, 2007), and 194 Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ; Raedeke & Smith, 2001). These questionnaires were 195 selected due to their sound psychometric properties, accessibility and conceptual relevance to the 196 variables under investigation. Participants were offered either a hard copy (n = 342) or online (n = 197 30) version of the questionnaire pack, which they selected according to preference. Online 198 questionnaires were completed using the Typeform web interface. 

199 **Measures**
200 **Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sports Performers (OSI-SP).** The OSI-SP 201 (Arnold et al., 2013) is a 23-item measure comprising 5 subscales, goals and development, 202 logistics and operations, team and culture, coaching, and selection. The 5-factor structure was 203 supported by confirmatory factor analysis (Arnold et al., 2013). Although Arnold et al. (2013) 204 suggested using all three rating scales (i.e., frequency, intensity, and duration) for a 205 comprehensive picture of performer-organization transactions, they argued that the frequency 206 scale alone would be adequate for researchers requiring a shorter version of the indicator. Hence, 207 in order to limit the number of items in the questionnaire pack, and in line with the view that 208 burnout is linked to chronic exposure to stressors (e.g., Dale & Weinberg, 1990), the frequency 209 scale alone was employed here. The OSI-SP items were scored on a Likert rating scale in relation 210 to the frequency of each organizational stressor, with options ranging from 0 to 5 for each stem. 211 For each item, the frequency (e.g., "how often did this pressure place demand on you?", 0 = 212 never, 5 = always), of organizational stressors encountered were measured. Acceptable omega 213 coefficients for each OSI-SP subscale were observed for the present sample: goals and 214 development (Ω = .75), logistics and operations (Ω = .83), team and culture (Ω = .62), coaching 215 (Ω = .78), and selection (Ω = .82).

216 **Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10).** In the absence of a sports217 specific measure of psychological resilience, the CD-RISC-10 (Campbell-Sills & Stein, 2007) 218 provided a measure of resilience for the purpose of this investigation. The CD-RISC-10 is a ten219 item measure (score range 0-40) that assesses personal resources or qualities deemed appropriate 220 for positive adaptation to adversity (viz. personal competence, high standards, tenacity, trust in 221 one's instincts, tolerance of negative affect, strengthening effects of stress, positive acceptance of 222 change, secure relationships, control, and spiritual influences). The questionnaire consists of ten 223 statements related to adapting to adverse situations (e.g. "I am able to adapt when changes 224 occur"). Each item was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 4 225 (true nearly all the time), with higher scores indicating recurrent use of each strategy. Gucciardi, 226 Jackson, Coulter, and Mallett (2011) reported good factorial validity analyses supporting the 10227 item unidimensional model compared to the original 25-item CD-RISC (Connor & Davidson, 228 2003), and internal reliability estimates with adult and adolescent cricketers. Satisfactory internal 229 consistency (Ω = .85) were observed in the present study. 

230 **Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ).** The ABQ (Raedeke & Smith, 2001) is a 15-item 231 measure and was developed specifically to measure burnout in athletes. The ABQ comprises of 232 three 5-item subscales designed to assess: (a) reduced sense of accomplishment (e.g., "I am not 233 achieving much in sport"), (b) sport devaluation (e.g., "I feel less concerned about being 234 successful in sport than I used to"), and (c) emotional/physical exhaustion (e.g., I feel overly tired 235 from my sport participation"). Two items are positively-framed and reverse scored. Participants 236 were required to answer each item on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 237 (almost always). Higher total scores on the ABQ indicated a greater degree of burnout. 238 Confirmatory factor analysis by Raedeke and Smith (2001) suggested acceptable construct 239 validity and Cronbach's alphas (between .85 and .91). Further, satisfactory test-retest reliability 240 from a sample of cross-country runners was reported (between .86 and .92). In the present study, 241 adequate omega reliability coefficients were reported for sport devaluation (Ω = .77) and 242 emotional and physical exhaustion (Ω = .86), but the omega for reduced sense of accomplishment 243 (Ω = .64) was slightly below the recommended threshold for adequacy.

244 **Data Analysis**
245 In order to investigate whether the effect of organizational stressors on burnout varied in 246 magnitude and nature as a function of resilience, simple moderation analysis was utilized (Hayes, 247 2009). This allowed the identification of statistical interactions between the predictor 248 (organizational stressors) and moderator (resilience) variables, and the strength and direction of 249 their collective effect on the outcome variable (burnout) (Judd, Kenny, & McClelland, 2001). 250 Further, moderation encapsulates the enhancement, reduction or changing influence of the 251 predictor as a result of the moderating variable (Fairchild & MacKinnon, 2009). In addition to the 252 simple moderation analyses, we also conducted additional regression analyses controlling for 253 resilience with the organizational stressor subscales in predicting burnout. Before commencing 254 the analysis, the moderation model was checked for statistical assumptions. This included OLS 255 regression assumptions (i.e., linear in parameters, random sample, random sample, more than 20:1 256 observations:n ratio, no perfect collinearity, zero conditional mean, homoscedasticity; Cohen, 257 Cohen, Aiken & West, 2003). Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 22 (IBM Corporation, 258 U.S.A) using Hayes's (2013) PROCESS macro. This regression-based path analytic framework 259 allows the configuration and estimation of interactions in moderation models. Nine participants 260 returned incomplete questionnaires and, therefore, had their responses excluded from the data 261 analysis. 263 Descriptive statistics and correlations can be seen in Table 1. For the main study variables, 264 there was a significant positive relationship between the frequency of organizational stressors and 265 burnout (r = .27, p < .01), providing support for Hypothesis 1a. In addition, a significant negative 266 relationship was found between resilience and burnout (r = -.46, p < .01). A significant 267 relationship was not found between the frequency of organizational stressors and resilience. 268 [Table 1 around here] 269 The simple moderation results are presented in Table 2. Consistent with Hypothesis 2a, 270 resilience moderated the relationship between organizational stressors and burnout in athletes (F 
(3, 373) = 44.86, p <.001, R2 271 = .29). For every one unit increase in resilience there was a -.22 272 decrease in burnout (b = -.22, t(373) = 85.46, p <.001) and for every one unit increase in stressor 273 frequency, there was a .93 increase in burnout (b = .93, t(373) = 4.98, p <.001). The interaction 274 between resilience and stressor frequency was (b = -.05, t(373) = -2.22, p < .05). Interaction 275 slopes for stressor frequency predicting burnout showed that at low levels of resilience burnout 276 scores increased by 1.25 (b = 1.25, t(373) = 5.04, p <.001) compared to athletes who reported 277 high levels of resilience, for whom burnout scores increased by .60 (b = .60, t(373) = 2.68, p 278 <.001). The moderation effects are presented graphically in Figure 1. 279 [Table 2 around here] 280 [Figure 1 around here] 281 We conducted further analyses to examine the contribution of each organizational stressor 282 subscale (see Table 3). After controlling for covariance among the subscales, moderation analyses 283 showed the team and culture, coaching, and goals and development subscales to be significant 284 predictors of burnout, but the logistics and operations and selection subscales did not. 

## 262 **Results** 286 **Discussion**

285 [Table 3 around here] 287 This study provides a novel empirical examination of the organizational stressor288 resilience-burnout relationship in a sport context. The findings indicate that the frequency of 289 organizational stressors was positively correlated with athlete burnout. Hence, Hypothesis 1a was 290 supported. Further, following simple moderation analysis (see Table 2), the frequency of 291 organizational stressors experienced by athletes interacted with psychological resilience to predict 292 burnout. That is, the results suggest the relationship between organizational stressor frequency 293 and burnout is significantly reduced in athletes with higher levels of resilience compared to those 294 with lower levels of resilience. Therefore, Hypothesis 2a was supported. 295 The data are comparable to those of Tabei et al. (2012), who reported a relationship 296 between organizational stressors and burnout using the ABQ and follow-up interviews with 297 soccer players. Hence, the empirical findings from the present study support and extend 298 theoretical links between stress and burnout in athletes (cf. Gustafsson et al., 2011; Raedeke & 299 Smith, 2004). Further, athletes in the present study with high resilience reported a lower incidence 300 of burnout when encountering comparable frequency of organizational stressors to those with low 301 resilience. One possible explanation for this protective effect is the elicitation of constructive 302 challenge appraisals, whereby athletes perceive stressors as opportunities for personal and skill 303 development. Nevertheless, it is beyond the scope of this study to ascertain whether resilience 304 promotes facilitative athlete responses in adverse circumstances and it is for future research to 305 examine such relationships. 306 In terms of the organizational stressor subscales, it is noteworthy that only three of the five 307 OSI-SP subscales individually predicted burnout when tested with resilience as a moderator. 308 These data highlight team and culture, coaching, and to a lesser extent, goals and development as 309 strong predictors of burnout, when controlling for other stressors and resilience. Moreover, such 310 findings have commonality with extant findings (see Arnold et al., 2016). Specifically, sport 311 performers competing at national or international level encountered a significantly higher 312 frequency of both goals and development and logistics and operations organizational stressors 313 than those competing at regional and university, and higher frequency of selection, goals and 314 development, and logistics and operations organizational stressors than those competing at county 315 and club level. The present sample was reflective of varying numbers of county (27%), regional 316 (13%), national (14%), and international (8%) performers, and as such, the future researchers 317 might undertake further examination of the influence of demographics on the stressor-burnout 318 relationship. 

321 **Participants**
322 For the purpose of this study, 69 male and 22 female coaches (n = 91) were recruited from 323 a broad range of individual and team sports (n = 26), with a sizeable proportion of coaches 324 specializing in association football (24.2%). The participants ranged in age from 21 to 60 years 325 (M = 31.1, SD = 12.3). On average, the participants coached in their current sport organization for 326 12.31 hours per week (SD = 12.82) and had been in their current position for 8.65 years (SD = 327 7.05). The participants coached at club (n = 26), county (n = 15), regional (n = 13), national (n = 328 21) and international (n = 16) levels at the time of the study. After receiving ethical approval, 329 participants were recruited via workplaces, university institutions, and sport organizations. The 330 sampling criteria specified that participants had to be currently coaching in a sport organization. 

331 **Procedure**
332 A questionnaire pack including the OSI-SP, CD-RISC-10, and the Coach Burnout 333 Questionnaire (CBQ) was distributed to coaches in this study. These questionnaires were selected 334 due to sound psychometric properties, accessibility and conceptual relevance to the variables 335 studied. The data collection protocol as described in Study 1 was repeated in Study 2, using the 336 online survey website Typeform (n = 18) and hard copy (n = 73) distribution techniques. 337 **Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sports Performers (OSI-SP).** See Study 1. 338 Acceptable omega coefficients were observed in this study for frequency of organizational 319 **Study 2**
320 **Method**
339 stressors in each subscale of the OSI-SP: goals and development (Ω = .77), logistics and 340 operations (Ω = .82), team and culture (Ω = .80), coaching (Ω = .78), selection (Ω = .87).

341 Connor-Davidson **Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10).** See Study 1. Acceptable omega 342 coefficients for the sample of coaches were observed for the present sample (Ω = .86).

343 **Coach Burnout Questionnaire (CBQ).** The CBQ (see Malinauskas, Malinauskiene & 344 Dumciene, 2010; is a 15-item measure based on the original ABQ (Raedeke & Smith, 2001), 345 specifically designed to assess burnout in coaches. The measure is based on the original ABQ, the 346 CBQ comprises of three 5-item subscales designed to assess: (a) reduced sense of 347 accomplishment, (b) sport devaluation, and (c) emotional/physical exhaustion, in line with the 348 multidimensional conceptualization of burnout (Raedeke, 1997). Of the 15 items, two are posed 349 positively and are reverse scored, with the remaining 13 being posed negatively. The original 350 ABQ question stems are altered for the CBQ to reflect coaching rather than athletic participation 351 in sport. For example, "I'm accomplishing many worthwhile things in [sport]" is changed to "I'm 352 accomplishing many worthwhile things coaching [sport]." Subjects are required to answer each 353 item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Higher scores 354 on the CBQ indicate a greater degree of burnout. Based on the examination of convergent and 355 discriminant validity of extant coach burnout measures, Lundkvist et al. (2014) supported the use 356 of the CBQ because of its coverage of important aspects of coach burnout that other measures do 357 not cover (e.g., Maslach Burnout Inventory; Maslach & Jackson, 1981, Oldenburg Burnout 358 Inventory; Halbesleben & Demerouti, 2005). In an examination of fit, clarity, and the meaning of 359 revised items the CBQ has been found to have appropriate content validity and item modification. 

360 For the present sample, adequate omega coefficients were observed for sport devaluation (Ω = 361 .78) and emotional and physical exhaustion (Ω = .88), but the omega for reduced sense of 362 accomplishment (Ω = .68) was slightly below the recommended threshold for adequacy.

363 Data Analysis 364 As in Study 1, simple moderation analysis was used to ascertain whether the effect of 365 organizational stressors on burnout varied in magnitude and nature as a function of resilience 366 (Hayes, 2009). The full procedure undertaken was as presented in Study 1, except in this study, 367 given the older ages of the participants, and evidence that resilience may be related to age, we 368 controlled for age within the analyses. Additionally, due to the smaller sample size, we did not 369 conduct additional regression analyses controlling for resilience with the organizational stressor 370 subscales in predicting burnout. 372 Descriptive statistics and correlations can be seen in Table 4. For the main study variables, 373 there was a significant positive relationship between the frequency of organizational stressors and 374 burnout (r = .38, p < .01), providing support for Hypothesis 1b. In addition, a significant negative 375 relationship between resilience and burnout (r = -.56, p < .01). 376 [Table 4 around here] 377 The simple moderation results are presented in Table 5. Consistent with Hypothesis 2b, resilience 378 moderated the relationship between organizational stressors and burnout in coaches (F (3,85) = 
28.78, p <.001, R2 379 = .49). Indeed, for every one unit increase in resilience, there was a -.29 380 decrease in burnout (b = -.29, t(85) = -6.78, p <.001) and for every one unit increase in 381 organizational stressor frequency, there was a 1.12 unit increase in burnout scores (b = 1.12, t(85) 382 = 3.52, p <.001). The interaction between resilience and stressor frequency was b = -.15, t(85) = - 383 3.27, p < .001. Interaction slopes for stressors predicting burnout showed that at low levels of 384 resilience burnout scores increased by 2.06 units (b = 2.06, t(85) = 4.27, p <.001), and for coaches 385 reporting high levels of resilience there was a non-significant increase in burnout (b = .19, t(85) = 386 .51, p = .61). When age was added as a covariate, these findings were not significantly different. 387 The moderation findings are presented graphically in Figure 2. 388 [Table 5 around here] 389 [Figure 2 around here] 390 Discussion

## 371 **Results** 411 **General Discussion**

391 This study provides a novel empirical examination of stress-resilience-burnout relationship 392 in sports coaches. In a similar manner to Study 1, comparable conclusions can be drawn from the 393 present study. That is, the findings provide evidence of the positive relationship between the 394 frequency of organizational stressors and burnout, and the moderating effect of psychological 395 resilience in coaches whereby, as psychological resilience increased, there was a significantly 396 weaker relationship between organizational stressors and burnout. Hence, hypotheses H1b and 397 H2b were supported. 398 Although the present study only offers a cross-sectional perspective, these findings 399 indicate that the development of coaches' psychological resilience characteristics might 400 ameliorate reports of reduced accomplishment, physical and emotional exhaustion, and 401 devaluation of coaching experienced in response to organizational stressors. In line with research 402 on coach stress (e.g., Fletcher & Scott, 2010; Rhind, Scott, & Fletcher, 2013; Thelwell, Weston, 403 Greenlees & Hutchings, 2008), it is not unreasonable to assume that more resilient coaches might 404 also be more likely to experience positive outcomes as a result of positive responses to adversity 405 (e.g., thriving, growth, adaptive coping resources) that might enhance their well-being. The 406 findings of Study 2 echo the work of Lundkvist et al. (2012), whose findings pointed to the 407 tendency for the accumulation of organizational stressors to lead to coach burnout. Indeed, the 408 present findings also support Lundkvist et al.'s concluding remarks that better support should be 409 provided to coaches to manage the "off-field" challenges associated with their role (cf. Fletcher & 410 Scott, 2010). 412 The aim of the studies reported here was to examine the extent to which organizational 413 stressor frequency was related to burnout and whether psychological resilience moderated any 414 such relationship. The main finding to emerge from these studies is that the experience of athlete 415 and coach burnout is moderated by the psychosocial dynamics within sport organizations (i.e., 416 organizational stressors) and that psychological resilience reduces the strength of this relationship. 417 The findings across both samples indicate that all organizational stressor dimensions are 418 positively related to all dimensions of burnout. That is, participants in the present studies 419 reporting encountering a higher frequency of organizational stressors felt more exhausted, 420 devalued their role in their sport organization, and felt they were accomplishing less in sport as an 421 athlete or coach, when compared to those who reported fewer organizational stressors. These 422 findings have similarity to past research revealing a relationship between unspecified perceived 423 stress and burnout (e.g., Gould et al., 1996; Kelley et al., 1999; Raedeke & Smith, 2004). Further, 424 several stressor-burnout dimension relationships in the present studies are noteworthy. There was 425 a medium positive correlation in both samples between organizational stressor frequency and 426 physical and emotional exhaustion (r = .34 and .54 respectively, p < 0.01), and a medium 427 relationship being between goals and development demands and physical and the emotional 428 exhaustion dimension of burnout. These findings parallel those of Chan (2003) who found role 429 stressors to have main effects on emotional exhaustion in a sample of prospective teachers. 430 Further, the coach data indicated that the organizational stressors most strongly correlated to 431 burnout were those aligned with goals and development and logistics and operations. In athletes, 432 the stressors most strongly associated with total burnout scores were those aligned with team and 433 culture demands. That organizational stressor dimensions were not related to resilience in the 434 athlete sample is also noteworthy, but perhaps not surprising given the tenets of the meta-model 435 of stress, emotions, and performance (Fletcher et al., 2006; Fletcher & Scott, 2010). That is, the 436 meta-model posits that stress resides neither in the person nor in the environment, but in the 437 relationship between the two. Hence, it is possible that resilience is one of a number of 438 characteristics that *moderate* the stress process, while the components of perception, appraisal and 439 coping *mediate* the relationship between stressors and responses (cf. Fletcher et al., 2006; Fletcher 440 & Scott, 2010; Hanton et al., 2012; Raedeke & Smith, 2004). Indeed, in light of the present data, 441 it might be beneficial to examine whether those who are more resilient perceive similar 442 frequencies of stressors, but attend to, appraise, respond to, and cope with these differently to 443 those who are less resilient. 444 The present examination of resilience as a moderating variable in the stress process is a 445 step toward addressing calls by organizational stress researchers in sport to move beyond the 446 examination of components of the stress process in isolation (e.g., Arnold & Fletcher, 2012; 447 Fletcher et al., 2006, 2012), by investigating the effects of a moderating variable such as 448 resilience. In doing so, the findings presented here indicate that interventions supporting 449 resilience, designed to protect and sustain well-being and performance in the face of adversity, 450 might benefit athletes and coaches in sport organizations (Fletcher & Sarkar, 2016). The findings 451 parallel those in other professional domains in highlighting the importance of resilience for 452 professional well-being such as social work (e.g., Kinman & Grant, 2011), teaching (e.g., Howard 453 & Johnson, 2004), medicine (e.g., Zwack & Schweitzer, 2013), human service managers (Zunz, 454 1998), and nursing (e.g., Edward & Hercelinskyj, 2007), physicians (e.g., Taku, 2014), civil 455 servants (e.g., Hao, Hong, Xu, Zhou & Xie, 2015), and students (e.g., Dyrbye et al., 2010). The 456 findings also align with a body of research that indicates training to better negotiate workplace 457 stressors leads to a healthier and more engaged workforce (e.g., Arnetz, Nevedal, Lumley, 458 Backman & Lublin, 2009; McCraty & Atkinson, 2012; Sood, Prasad, Schroeder, & Varkey, 459 2011). Researchers seeking to examine the relationship between organizational stressors 460 individual outcomes (e.g., attitudes, mental health and subjective well-being, psychosocial, 461 physical/biological, and performance) in sport might adopt ideographic longitudinal designs. It 462 will also be important to clarify which psychological resilience qualities best protect against 463 which types of organizational stressors to prevent particular burnout dimensions (Sarkar & 464 Fletcher, 2014b). Further, given the present findings, research examining the effectiveness of 465 resilience-building at the individual, team and organization levels is relevant (see Wagstaff, 466 Sarkar, Davidson, & Fletcher, 2017), and would also align with the calls by Wagstaff and 467 colleagues for a positive organizational psychology of sport (POPS; Wagstaff et al., 2012a; 468 2012b). 469 In addition to the contribution to stress and resilience knowledge, the present studies also 470 advance burnout theory. The findings presented in this article provide a step toward better 471 conceptual understanding burnout in athletes and coaches and extends the research on the factors 472 that mediate or moderate stress-burnout relationship. For example, Gustafsson et al.'s (2011) 473 integrated model of athlete burnout outlines perfectionism, trait anxiety, low social support, lack 474 of coping skills, goal orientation, and motivational climate as vulnerability factors. The present 475 findings indicate that psychological resilience should be added to this list of factors. Despite these 476 advances, much remains to be examined in terms of other antecedent (e.g., perceptions of control) 477 and consequence (e.g., turnover) components related to burnout. For example, Kinman and Grant 478 (2011) found a significant negative relationship between resilience and psychological distress in 479 social workers. The authors highlighted that emotional and social competencies (i.e., emotional 480 intelligence, reflective ability, empathy and social competence) were important protective factors 481 and, therefore, present possible areas for researchers in sport to investigate. Elsewhere, in a 482 narrative review, Strümpfer (2003) argued that there are other psychological variables allied with, 483 or possibly subsumed by, resilience that might buffer against burnout; engagement, 484 meaningfulness, subjective well-being, positive emotions, and proactive coping. Future research 485 on resilience-burnout might seek to incorporate these variables. 486 While there is a considerable body of research examining athlete burnout, little of this 487 research has resulted in the development of methods for successfully reducing the incidence of 488 burnout in sport. There also remains a need for evidence-based research evaluating the design and 489 effectiveness of stress management and resilience training interventions in sport. Given the 490 present findings, we hope that sport psychology scholars are encouraged to conduct applied 491 research to further examine the role of psychological resilience in the prediction of burnout in 492 athletes, coaches, and others who operate in sport organizations. In doing so, these findings might 493 serve to elevate the salience of psychological resilience in sport and galvanize its emerging place 494 as a topic of interest into one of prominence within models of stress and burnout. 495 In addition to the theoretical advancement outlined above, it seems incumbent upon sport 496 organizations to drive appropriate change to minimize demands for those individuals to whom 497 they have a duty of care. While the development of intra-individual protective resources might be STRESSORS, RESILIENCE AND BURNOUT 20 498 quicker and easier, inter-personal and organizational level improvements connected to the 499 individual in the workplace might have a more pervasive and long-lasting impact on burnout. That 500 is, equipping individuals in sport organizations with techniques to reduce job stress is likely to be 501 helpful (see Didymus & Fletcher, 2017), but such methods can be more effective if the 502 organization also seeks to make operating in sport less stressful to begin with (cf. Fletcher et al., 503 2006; Rumbold, Fletcher, & Daniels, 2012; Fletcher & Sarkar, 2016). An organizational response 504 to stress and burnout requires the recognition of the phenomena as a legitimate *workplace* 505 problem and a sustained and systematic commitment to developing organization-wide 506 preventative protocols and initiatives Moreover, genuine efforts to prevent and alleviate burnout 507 among athletes, coaches and other professionals within sport organizations (e.g., support staff) 508 might also have purposeful or serendipitous positive effects, including increased performance, 509 improved quality of work life, higher levels of satisfaction and commitment, and lower turnover 510 (see, for a review, Wagstaff et al., 2017). 511 The main limitation of the present research is the use of a cross-sectional, self-report 512 design. Such designs preclude analysis of the influence of moderating variables (i.e., resilience) 513 on the stressor-burnout relationship over time. Hence, notwithstanding the replication of the main 514 findings using independent samples presented here, the authors would encourage researchers to 515 examine the longitudinal, predictive role of resilience in the stressor-burnout relationship. A 516 second limitation relates to the respective measures used in the present research. The authors 517 adopted an evidence-based selection process to identify the most suitable measures available, yet 518 each measure has strengths and limitations. To elaborate, in the absence of a sport-specific 519 measure of resilience (see Sarkar & Fletcher, 2013), we selected the CD-RISC-10 as the most 520 appropriate available measure given Gucciardi et al.'s (2011) favorable evaluation of its 521 psychometric properties. The current research provides further support for the use of the CD- 522 RISC10 in sport. Nevertheless, we reiterate recent calls for the development of a measure of 523 psychological resilience for specific use in sport contexts (see Gucciardi et al., 2011; Sarkar & 524 Fletcher, 2013, 2014) and for the purpose of greater conceptual-measurement harmony. 525 Researchers should also continue to seek and utilize the most psychometrically robust inventories 526 to measure coach burnout given the low omega coefficients (.64 and .68 respectively) observed 527 for the reduced sense of accomplishment subscales in the present studies. We would also advise 528 caution when interpreting the team and culture subscale data from Study 1 for similar reasons 529 (i.e., α = .62), and encourage researchers to undertake further validation of the psychometric 530 properties of this measure to ensure researchers' confidence in its use. Moreover, although a 531 recent review of the available coach burnout measures championed the use of the CBQ over 532 alternatives (e.g., MBI, OBI), the original validation of this measure was conducted in Lithuanian 533 and not English. Hence, further evidence of its validation might enhance confidence in its utility. 534 A possible third limitation relates to the potentially confounding effects of the athlete sample demographics. That is, a sample of largely young (M = 21years 535 ), male (57%), competitive athletes 536 (37%) was included. Despite the moderate imbalance toward non-elite young males, we do not 537 believe that the data were biased or unrepresentative of competition level, given the sampling of 538 county (27%), regional (13%), national (14%), and international (8%) participants. Nevertheless, 539 the reader should note the imbalanced gender and age sampling when drawing conclusions from 540 these data. 541 In summary, our results corroborate and extend theory and research linking stressors and 542 burnout in athletes and coaches, and illustrate the role of resilience in this relationship. Indeed, 543 these findings offer a novel empirical examination of resilience as a moderator of the 544 organizational stress-burnout relationship, and significantly contribute to extant mechanistic 545 knowledge. Hence, these results highlight the role that resilience plays in burnout and add to the 546 broader literature on each of the main variables in the general psychology domain. Future research 547 is needed that assesses the influence of resilience on other well-being and performance outcomes 548 in the stress process, and the efficacy of resilience-building interventions at intra-individual, inter549 individual and environmental levels, to prevent burnout. 551 Arnetz, B.
