## Abstract

Due to the frequent occurrence of global threats in recent years, it is necessary for researchers to closely examine how resilience afects poor mental health. However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating whether resilience moderates the association between emotion-focused coping style and negative afect. Based on this premise, we examined the psychological mechanisms connecting resilience with health by investigating daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, resilience and negative afect. Using daily diary approach, this study investigated the impact of daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, and outcome-oriented resilience on negative afect among 69 university students with a mean age of 19.76 (SD=0.97) in a 30-day study. Furthermore, we employed the residual approach to operationalize resilience as an outcome and investigated its moderating efect on the relationships between daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style and negative afect. Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, and outcome-oriented resilience signifcantly predicted daily negative afect. Additionally, interindividual diferences in outcome-oriented resilience moderated the relationship between emotion-focused coping style and negative afect but not the association between daily stressors and negative afect. Participants with higher levels of resilience exhibited greater reactivity to negative afect when utilizing emotion-focused coping style, as opposed to those with lower levels of resilience. This research improves understanding of the psychological mechanisms linking outcome-oriented resilience to mental health.

## Introduction Literature Review

The recent increase in global threats, along with the signifcant life changes associated with adjusting to college life, such as increased academic demands compared to middle school and adapting to a new social environment, has resulted in higher levels of stress among college students. Consequently, this has contributed to a parallel increase in mental health issues, including elevated levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and psychological distress (Ahluwalia et al., 

* Xia Shi shix@tute.edu.cn 1 Department of Psychology, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, No.1310 Dagu South Road, He Xi District, Tianjin 300222, China
2023). In order to mitigate the persistent adverse outcomes caused by these stressors and return to normal mental health functioning, it is helpful to focus on improving one's own resilience. Studies have shown that enhancing resilience in response to stress-related challenges is crucial for minimizing the adverse efects of stress on individual well-being and prosperity (Yıldırım & Green, 2023). This emphasizes the urgent necessity to pay greater attention to the mechanisms through which resilience impacts mental health in preparation for future challenges.

Resilience research dates back to the 1970s, and over the past 50 years, researchers' interest in resilience has fuctuated, with a notable increase during times of natural disasters or pandemics (Masten et al., 2021). In earlier studies, resilience was defned as the ability to recover or rebound from stress (Hu et al., 2015). However, over the past two decades, the defnition of resilience has changed signifcantly from a trait-oriented approach to an outcome-oriented approach (Chmitorz et al., 2018). In recent years, resilience has been defned by more studies as an outcome (Kalisch et al., 2015) 
in which individuals do not exhibit lasting mental health problems during times of adversity. In this study, the defnition of outcome-oriented resilience is consistent with prior research that demonstrates individuals can maintain positive mental health outcomes despite experiencing adversity 
(Kalisch et al., 2017).

The coupling between resilience and afect seems unquestionable, as evidenced by numerous studies demonstrating that resilience is associated with decreased negative afect and increased positive afect. Individuals with greater resilience experience fewer negative afect (Tung et al., 2022). 

Cross-sectional study samples in published resilience studies included adolescents, the elderly, normal individuals, and patients with various psychosomatic disorders. For instance, a cross-sectional study conducted on gastric cancer patients revealed that those with high resilience were linked to lower levels of negative afect (Zou et al., 2018). Similar fndings were observed in studies involving informal caregivers of the elderly and other clinical patients (Hamama-Raz et al., 2022). However, longitudinal studies, which are considered the gold standard for resilience research, are rarely reported. Additionally, there has been little focus on how resilience infuences the association between daily stressors and afect.

Daily stress is a signifcant factor in this coupled system, encompassing the regular challenges of daily life, such as interpersonal conficts, commuting, and deadlines, which can immediately or cumulatively afect emotional well-being (Charles et al., 2013). Some longitudinal studies used the elderly or adults as samples, which consistently revealed that negative afect states are associated with daily life stress 
(Drake et al., 2022; Hartsell & Neupert, 2019), and subsequent research has shown a positive correlation between higher levels of daily stress and negative afect (Richardson, 2017). However, despite the identifcation of certain variables such as reappraisal and aging processes that mediate the impact of daily stress on negative afect (Johnson et al., 
2016), there has been limited exploration into the relationship between resilience, daily stressors and negative afect. 

Specifcally, it remains unclear whether resilience moderates the efect of daily stressors on afect.

Earlier research has indicated that daily stressors account for negative afect successful stress management (Leger et al., 2018), but what other factors may contribute to negative afect? A study examining coping styles and depression revealed that an emotion-focused coping style explained 32% of the variance in negative afect (Smith et al., 2016), that means it was a strong predictor of depressed afect. The transactional theory of emotions and coping defnes emotion-focused coping as a regulatory style for managing emotional distress caused by external stressors, typically employed in situations that require acceptance rather than change (Lazarus & Folkman, 1987). In the theory, in the absence of efective emotion regulation strategies, emotion-focused coping style is likely to be characterized by a heightened focus on negative afect (Endler & Parker, 1994). However, the selection of emotion regulation mechanisms, such as coping with and enduring stress versus avoiding it, is infuenced by various factors, including the availability of coping resources (Smith et al., 2016). This also implies that the efect of theoretically emotion-focused coping on negative afect would take diferent forms. Lazarus's earlier fndings indicated that emotion-focused coping style as one of the process-based theories of coping, could alleviate psychological distress (Lazarus, 1993). This perspective is supported by other studies as well, in situations where the stressor is unalterable, utilizing emotion-focused coping style may be a suitable approach (Shigeto et al., 2021). 

However, this appears to confict with recent researches, a research indicated that emotion-focused coping style not only fail to alleviate loneliness in older adults but may actually exacerbate the condition (Schoenmakers et al., 2015). A separate study, which compared the mental health of adolescents before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, indicated that employing emotion-focused coping style mechanisms heightened negative mental health symptoms during the pandemic (Hussong et al., 2021). We are currently exploring likely explanations for this apparent inconsistency and proposing that a moderating factor may exist between emotionfocused coping style and psychological symptoms. Based on a comprehensive literature review, it is evident that there exists a paucity of research studies examining the interaction between resilience and emotion-focused coping style, particularly those employing longitudinal follow-up designs. In addition, previous study has shown that there are signifcant diferences between coping styles with trait and the more transient coping styles in daily life (Compton et al., 2011), which also means that there will be diferences between the emotion-centered coping styles previously measured based on cross-sectional and measured by the diary design of this study. Therefore, investigating the impact of emotionfocused coping style on afect and exploring whether resilience moderates this efect represents an urgent priority in the feld of resilience and coping.

Previous research, respectively, has highlighted the significance of daily stressors and emotion-focused coping style as variables in understanding the negative afect (Leger et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2016), and trait-oriented resilience was demonstrated to regulate the relationship between stressful events and adverse health symptoms (Li et al., 2020). 

However, it remains unclear to the precise nature of the relationship between resilience and daily stressors, coping styles, and negative afect and to what extent resilience can moderate emotion-focused coping (Smout et al., 2022). What's more, due to its temporal and developmental nature, cross-sectional measurements of the relationship between trait-oriented mental resilience and mental health are no longer deemed suitable for current research demands. On the contrary, longitudinal studies which integrated patterns of within-individual variation and between-individual variation, incorporating experience sampling and daily diary assessments are considered highly signifcant within the research framework on resilience (Ong & Leger, 2022). 

However, limited research has not examined whether outcome-oriented resilience moderated the relationship between daily stressors or emotion-focused coping style and negative afect in diary studies.

## The Present Study

This study aims to investigate potential moderating role of outcome-oriented resilience in the relationships between predictor variables, such as daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, and the outcome variable (i.e., negative afect) 
utilizing a hierarchical linear model. In this model, we consider daily stressors and emotion-focused coping style as independent variables at level 1, while outcome-oriented resilience is regarded as an inter-individual variable at level 2. In order to expand upon the fndings of prior cross-sectional studies, this study proposed the following hypotheses. A conceptual diagram illustrates the study hypotheses is presented in Fig. 1.

First (H1): We included daily stressors as a level-1 predictor to further investigate this potential moderation, and the more daily stressors participants encountered, the higher the negative afect in level 1. Second (H2): We employed emotion-focused coping style as a predictor variable for level 1 analysis, and the more individuals use emotion-centered coping style, the more negative afect they have.

Thirdly (H3): We hypothesized that outcome-oriented resilience, would moderate the relationship between daily stressors and negative afect. Specifcally, individuals Fig. 1 Schematic representation 

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

of the study hypothesis who possess higher resilience experience fewer negative afect when confronted with daily stressors.

Forth (H4): We hypothesized that outcome-oriented resilience would moderate the association between emotionfocused coping and negative afect. This is based on the premise that individuals with higher levels of resilience are likely to experience reduced negative afect when employing emotion-focused coping style.

## Method Participants

Participants were recruited through the ofcial recruitment platform of Tianjin University of Technology and Education to participate in a longitudinal study. Individuals were required to have sufcient availability of time in order to be eligible for participation in the longitudinal study. Participants completed a cross-sectional questionnaire on the frst day of the 30-day follow-up period, and then they flled out daily questionnaires at the end of each 24-h period from October 30 to November 30, 2022. During the follow-up period, we employed an online survey method using the Questionnaire Star platform to collect the questionnaire data. 

Each participant was assigned a unique ID by the experimenter prior to starting the survey. Participants were then required to enter their assigned ID and name each time they completed the online questionnaire, ensuring proper matching of their responses. The selection of a 30-day duration for the diary design was based on empirical considerations, aiming to strike a balance between maximizing sampling frequency and minimizing the burden on participants (Hetland et al., 2022; Hisler et al., 2019; Wemm et al., 2022). Upon completion of the longitudinal follow-up questionnaire, all participants were provided with fnancial compensation.

69 participants completed daily diary procedures, of whom 76% were male, with a mean age of 19.76 years (SD =0.97, range 17–23 years). Notably, Subject No.60 completed the survey for fve days, subject No.34 completed the survey for seven days, while some other participants missed completing some questionnaires on several occasions. Participants provided a total of 1958 responses to the questionnaire, yielding an average of 28.38 responses per participant. Hox's study suggests that a group size of fve is sufcient and normal for longitudinal studies (Maas & Hox, 2005), thereby enabling all collected data to be incorporated into a multilevel linear model for analysis.

## Measures

Day‑level variables Emotion‑focused coping style The Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) was used to assess emotionfocused coping style and efectively measure the three fundamental dimensions of task, emotion, and avoidance (Endler & Parker, 1994). Previous longitudinal studies used a set of three items extracted from the CISS to assess emotionfocused coping style (Compton et al., 2011), which have been shown to be efective, and this study used the same items as a previous study, selected items included "I blamed myself for situations", "I criticized myself", and "I focused on my inadequacies". The internal consistency of emotionfocused coping style exhibited high reliability (Cronbach's α=0.81) in the present study.

Negative afect The negative subscale of Positive and Negative Afect Schedule (PANAS) was used to assess negative afect (Watson et al., 1988), which has been demonstrated to be reliable and valid in the Chinese population (Huang et al., 2003). The questionnaire consisted of 10 negative adjectives, such as distressed and scared. Participants were asked to report on a fve-point Likert scale (ranging from 1="Very Slightly or Not at All" to 5="Extremely") to assess their emotional state at the end of each day between 8 and 10 p.m.. The present study found a high level of internal consistency in negative afect, with a Cronbach's α coefcient of 0.93.

Daily stress Two scales were utilized to assess the daily stress levels of students. The frst scale consisted of a fouritem questionnaire, which was derived from a 14-day followup study (Compton et al., 2008) and aimed to measure common stressors experienced during the academic year, such as 
"a lot of responsibilities", "had a deadline to worry about", "too many things to do at once", and "not enough time to meet obligations". Participants reported how much stressors which had occurred during that day have been a part of their life (1=not at all true, 4=very much true), fnally, the total score of all items was calculated to quantify the variable of daily stressors. In this study, the questionnaire report on daily stressors showed satisfactory internal consistency reliability with a Cronbach's α coefcient of 0.86.

The second scale was used to assess participants' daily perceived global stress (Cohen et al., 1983), which has been validated by multiple studies since its inception. The version used in this study was based on the Chinese adaptation of the Perceived Stress Scale (Wang et al., 2011). The perceived stress scale consists of ten items in total. Examples of these items include: "In the past day, how much time have you been able to control your anger?" and "How many times in the past day have you felt confdent in your ability to deal with personal issues?" The overall Cronbach's α of the Chinese-revised scale was 0.86, and Cronbach's α was 0.81 in this research, indicating that the scale has great internal consistency reliability.

The two variables served diferent purposes, calculating outcome-oriented resilience through stressors necessitates a comprehensive compilation of daily stressors (Veer et al., 2021). In this study, daily stressors only included common stressors experienced during the academic year. Hence, perceived stress being considered as part of calculating outcome-oriented resilience and the variable of daily stressors was used as the independent variable at level 1 to explore the efect of daily stressors on negative afect.

## Participant‑Level Variables

Outcome‑oriented resilience The measurement of resilience in this study was not limited to a single scale. Resilience, as defned by previous research, refers to individuals who do not develop persistent mental health issues despite being exposed to adversity (Kalisch et al., 2015). In other words, resilience refers to a positive mental health outcome in the face of stressors, necessitating an evaluation that encompasses both major and minor stressors experienced by individuals (Veer et al., 2021). In addition, the current study employed a residualization method to assess outcome-oriented resilience, which was operationalized as the diference between the actual and predicted scores of mental health measures. The advantage of using residual as an indicator of resilience is that it can correct for individual diferences in perceived daily life stress (Veer et al., 2021), and this metric has been validated in an increasing number of studies (Bögemann et al., 2023; Veer et al., 2021). Following the defnition, the current study employed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to assess daily perceived stress, and negative afect was incorporated as a variable to characterize participants' daily mental health status. The standardized average self-reported data collected over thirty consecutive days was used to construct a regression curve, which provides a normative prediction of an individual's mental health reactivity to perceived stress. The residual, defned as the diference between the actual and predicted scores, was utilized as a metric for measuring an individual's psychological resilience. A higher residual score on this metric indicated a lower level of resilience.

In the study, we included the Daily Stressor Scale as an independent variable at level one in a hierarchical linear model because it refects stressor exposure based on the frequency of stressor occurrence and is not afected by individual diferences in stressor perception or evaluation. Our hypothesis is that daily stressors signifcantly predict negative afect. We constructed a monotonic regression curve to explore the association between negative afect and perceived stress, as it takes into account the actual severity of stressors perceived by individuals. The residual of the curve serves as an indicator of resilience. We used Mahalanobis distance to identify outliers in the regression curves thereby prevent any possible data bias. Cases with Chi-Square values corresponding to p<0.001 were removed from the analysis. Data will be shared in public repository before publication.

## Statistical Analysis

Considering the nested data structure, a Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) was employed to investigate the moderating efect of resilience on the association between emotion-focused coping style or daily stressors and daily negative afect. The repeated measures across the 30 days (Level 1) were nested within participants (Level 2). Daily negative afect was treated as outcome variables in the two-level model. The daily stressors and emotion-focused coping style were treated as random coefcients at level 1, while the resilience per participant were included as level 2 predictors. To test hypothesis H3 and H4, cross-level interactions of resilience were included in the model. In addition, trait anxiety can be considered synonymous with neuroticism in mental health research (Barlow et al., 2014), and previous research has established that neuroticism was one of the most robust predictors of negative afect (Howell & Rodzon, 2011), in other words, it is plausible to hypothesize that trait anxiety serves as a predictor of negative afect. Given this, trait anxiety was included as a level 2 covariate in the present study. All non-binary variables measured at Level 1 were group mean centered, while Level 2 were grand mean centered. The equations for the fnal model were as follows:

Level 1: $NA_{\bar{n}}=\pi_{0i}+\pi_{1i}\Big{(}DS_{\bar{n}}-\overline{DS}_{i}\Big{)}+\pi_{2i}\Big{(}EFC_{\bar{n}}-\overline{EFC}_{i}\Big{)}+\varepsilon_{ii}$

$$\pi_{0i}=\beta_{00}+\beta_{01}\left(TA_{i}\right)+\beta_{02}\left(RES_{i}\right)+\gamma_{0i}$$  Level 2: $\pi_{1i}=\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}\left(RES_{i}-RES.\right)+\gamma_{1i}$  $$\pi_{2i}=\beta_{20}+\beta_{21}\left(RES_{i}-RES.\right)+\gamma_{2i}$$

In the model, DS, EFC, TA and RES were in order represented daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, trait anxiety, and outcome-oriented resilience. In the Level 1 equation, π0i was the intercept indicating participant i's average level of negative afect without variables. π1i and π2i, respectively, represented changes in participants' negative afect under the infuence of daily stressors and emotionfocused coping style. At Level 2, the slope coefcient π1i for each participant i was modelled as a function of resilience, β11 represents the cross-layer interaction, which was interpreted as the moderating efect of resilience on the relationship between daily stressors and negative afect. Similarly, the slope coefcient π2i was modelled as a function of resilience, and β21 was interpreted as the moderating efect of resilience on the relationship between emotion-focused coping style and negative afect.

All the multilevel analyses were conducted with full maximum likelihood estimation in HLM 6.08; other analyses were performed using SPSS version 27, and R version 4.2.3.

## Results Descriptive Statistics

The cross-sectional measure was completed by all 69 participants. During data collection, a few subjects lost some of their daily measurements, resulting in a total of 1958 daily measurements being collected. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for all variables at level 1 and level 2 and pearson correlation coefcient between variables. In Table 1, the residuals are reversed to resilience for ease of understanding, for example, the residuals are positively related to negative afect in the original data, while Table 1 shows that resilience is negatively related to negative afect.

## Multilevel Modeling Analyses

A null model was used to assess the variance in daily negative afect both between and within participants. Results revealed that 37% (σ2=0.26) of the variance was withinperson and 63% (τ00=0.44) was between-person, which suggested that the Intraclass Coefcient (ICC) of the null model is sufciently large to indicate its similarity cannot be ignored, thus making it appropriate for multilevel linear regression analysis. The post-hoc test indicated that the multilevel linear regression had an efect size of 0.36.

Table 2 presented the parameters and signifcance levels of the full model. The model results indicated that participants would experience more negative afect on days with more stressors compared to those with fewer stressors (β10 of Table 2). As expected, another independent variable at Level 1 indicated that the emotion-focused coping style was a valid

The abscissa axis and the vertical axis represent residual and the efect of emotion-focused coping on negative afect, respectively. The solid line that slopes downward to the right shows that the efect of emotion-focused coping on negative afect gradually declines with advancing residual (i.e., resilience levels are decreasing)
*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 predictor of increased negative afect (β20 of Table 2), this means that the more emotion-focused coping style used on a daily basis, the higher their negative afect.

Table 2 shows that diferences in the mean levels of negative afect regarding resilience was represented by β02. This fnding can be explained by the fact that individuals with lower resilience, or higher residual, tend to experience a greater level of negative afect (β02=0.824, p<0.000). As predicted by the fourth hypothesis, the signifcance of β21 suggested that resilience moderated the relationship between daily emotion-focused coping style and daily negative afect. Resilience was operationalized in this study as the residual of the regression curve, as explained earlier. A positive residual value indicated a higher level of negative afect than the expected standard response, suggesting lower resilience (Kalisch et al., 2020). Conversely, a negative residual value implied a lower level of negative afect under the same emotion-focused coping style, indicating stronger resilience. As shown Fig. 2, the Johnson-Neyman simple slope plot using R Studio, in which ofers a more comprehensive understanding of how the infuence of a predictor variable on a outcome variable is contingent upon the full range of a moderator, and the J-N plot to represent the role of moderating variables in a longitudinal design has been used in previous studies (Brem et al., 2021). The plot showed that the slope of emotionfocused coping style gradually decreased as the residual value increased, and the moderating efect was signifcant within the observed range. The fndings suggested that the negative afect of individuals with lower levels of resilience is less afected by emotion-focused coping style (the closer to the right end of the horizontal axis of the J-N plot, the residual greater, the resilience smaller and the smaller the slope of emotion-focused coping style), while those with higher levels of resilience are more infuenced by coping style. Specifcally, although participants with higher levels of resilience had lower initial levels of negative afect compared to those with lower resilience levels, under the infuence of emotion-focused coping style, their negative afect increased at a faster rate. It should be noted that in this study, we used plus or minus one standard deviation 
(±1SD= ±0.50) to distinguish between high and low levels of resilience.

The results of the full model partly confrmed the frst, second and fourth hypotheses of this study, namely that daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style signifcantly predicted daily negative afect, and the outcome-oriented resilience moderated the relationship between emotion-focused coping style and negative afect. The third hypothesis was not verifed, in the results we did not fnd a moderating efect of resilience on daily stressors and negative afect.

## Discussion

The current study examined the infuence of daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, and individual diferencesspecifcally resilience—on negative afect. We postulated that the measured variables would serve as predictors of negative afect, and this was corroborated by the multilevel model. Specifically, increased daily stressors predicted increased daily negative afect, consistent with previous research (Drake et al., 2022), but a moderating role of outcome-oriented resilience on this basis was not found. Another predictor, emotion-focused coping style, was also shown to be predictive of daily negative afect, extending previous fndings based on cross-sectional measures (Smith et al., 2016), and outcome-oriented resilience moderated this relationship. To some extent, this is also consistent with Lazarus' the transactional theory of emotions and coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1987), which inferred that compared to other styles, emotion-focused coping style are infuenced by personal factors, such as resilience. Importantly, this study employed a diary-based design, which contrasted with hypothesis and previous research (Smith et al., 2016) that concluded that individuals with high resilience would be less negatively afected by emotion-focused coping style. The fndings of this study suggested that emotion-focused coping style has a stronger impact on the experience of negative afect in individuals with higher resilience.

This study expanded upon prior research by quantifying resilience using a residualization method, based on thirty consecutive days of data collection. This paper has further validated and expanded upon the previous study on resilience (Bögemann et al., 2023) by utilizing the residual in the regression curve as an indicator. Through daily diary methods, negative afect and daily perceived stress reports of subjects were plotted to create a monotonic regression curve over thirty consecutive days. This analysis serves as a predictive model for determining subjects' mental health responsiveness to perceived stressors. Based on the robust regression relationships, it can be relatively intuitive to suggest that individuals exhibit varying degrees of impairment in mental health functioning under daily life stress. Those individuals whose actual measured scores were lower than those predicted by the regression curve, which could be considered as having higher psychological resilience, due to showing lower than expected negative afect while controlling for daily stressors, whereas other participants' measured scores higher than the regression curve were the opposite.

The intercept model of the multilevel linear model revealed that outcome-oriented resilience and trait-oriented resilience had comparable outcomes. Specifcally, individuals with higher levels of resilience experienced fewer negative afect than those with lower adaptability (Tung et al., 
2022). Inconsistencies in the defnition of resilience, as demonstrated by previous research, have hindered the evaluation and comparison of research fndings (Hu et al., 2015). The outcome-oriented resilience discovered in this study is consistent with previous research on trait-oriented resilience, which supported the hypothesis. Trait-oriented research posited that resilience remains relatively stable over time and can mitigate or minimize the negative efects of exposure to traumatic events or adversity (Hu et al., 2015). This may be determined by the trait of hardiness, which is a personality type that enhances an individual's capacity to adapt to stress or adversity (Chmitorz et al., 2018). However, personality is just one of the various factors that contribute to mental health restoration or maintenance in an outcome-oriented defnition of resilience, and on this basis, researchers should avoid confating facilitating factors with resilience outcomes (Kalisch et al., 2015). Therefore, it can be inferred that the concept of resilience as an outcome partially encompasses the notion of resilience as a trait. This may explain why our study's measurement of outcome-oriented resilience was consistent with previous research on trait-oriented resilience.

Regarding the relationship between coping styles and negative afect, this study afrmed the belief that utilizing emotion-focused coping style could exacerbate negative afect. 

Additionally, previous studies failed to provide sufcient evidence supporting the efectiveness of emotion-focused coping style in enhancing emotional states (Gruszczyńska, 2013). 

The multilevel linear model utilized in this study has demonstrated that the utilization of emotion-focused coping style has exerted a signifcant impact on daily negative afect, displaying a positive correlation trend. Although this may seem contradictory to Shigeto's perspective (Shigeto et al., 2021), the intricate nature of emotion-focused coping style has consistently garnered support in published literature (Gruszczyńska, 2013). According to the research of Turgut et al. (2017), the observed efect in this study can be explained by the hypothesis that regular employment of this coping mechanism may augment challenging and obstructive stress factors, leading to more frequent occurrences of negative afect.

More importantly, our results provided evidence for the hypothesized cross-layer interaction of emotion-focused coping style and resilience which was defned as having a good psychological outcome when people experience challenges. When examining the moderating efect of resilience, based on the slope of Fig. 2, we observed that individuals exhibiting greater resilience (i.e. lower residual) exhibited heightened reactivity to negative afect when utilizing emotion-focused coping, in contrast to those with lesser resilience (i.e. higher residual). As the residual increased, meaning people with lower levels of resilience, the impact of emotion-focused coping style on experiencing negative afect decreased. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that individuals with higher levels of resilience exhibited greater sensitivity to external pressures, which results in heightened reactivity when employing such coping mechanisms. According to the afective-signaling hypothesis, there is a bidirectional relationship between afect and cognitive control (Dignath et al., 2020). This means that the amplifcation of negative afect caused by stress is not necessarily maladaptive, as commonly assumed; instead, it can motivate individuals to take adaptive actions in response (Lin et al., 2023). That is to say, in individuals with higher levels of outcome-oriented resilience, the emotion-focused coping style hold a more positive connotation as it facilitates timely adaptation to adversity by enhancing sensitivity towards negative afect.

In addition, our fndings suggested that resilience did not moderate the relationship between daily stressors and negative afect, and previous research has yet to clarify the interaction among resilience, daily stressors, and negative afect. 

Considering the reality of the study period, it is possible that the main daily stressors during the measurement period were universal and unchangeable for individuals. Therefore, resilience may not have shown a moderating efect on daily stressors and negative afect.

## Limitations And Future Directions

While operationalizing resilience as the residual between measured and predicted scores is a favorable strength of this study, characterizing resilience as a positive mental health outcome in response to stress is limited by its inclusion of only one sample of college students. These encouraging results should be validated in a larger cohort encompassing various ages and groups. Moreover, we employed selfreport measures through daily diaries to evaluate daily stress levels, negative afect, and other related factors. However, this approach may be susceptible to recall bias. To increase ecological validity in future longitudinal studies, it would be advantageous to employ methods such as day reconstruction or physiological indicators like heart rate variability and the cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio, which are commonly used in professional settings.

In addition, we selected a sample with an unbalanced ratio of male to female, and there may be diferences in perceived stress between male and female, which may have an impact on the model result. Specifcally, we examined the diferences in perceived stress, daily stressors, and trait anxiety between male and female. Our fndings revealed that although there were some diferences in daily stressors between the two groups, there were no signifcant diferences in perceived stress and trait anxiety. To address this potential bias, future research will strive to achieve a balance in sample sizes between male and female. This will enable us to further explore the moderating efect of outcome-oriented resilience on daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style and negative afect.

A more fundamental issue lies in the absence of a consensus on how to measure resilience. Despite the growing recognition of resilience as an outcome variable in recent years (Chmitorz et al., 2018), and our study's consideration of daily stressors and mental health, there is currently no universally accepted method for evaluating resilience. Future research could aim to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms to provide robust evidence for outcome-based indicators of resilience.

## Conclusion

In summary, our study developed a multilevel linear model that included daily stressors, emotion-focused coping style, resilience, and negative affect. An outstanding highlight of the study was the use of a residualization approach to quantify outcome-oriented resilience. The result revealed that individuals with high residual scores exhibited lower levels of resilience and reported greater daily negative affect. Furthermore, the results indicated that outcome-oriented resilience played a moderating role in the relationship between emotion-focused coping style and negative affect. Specifically, individuals perceived as resilient exhibit a higher rate of negative affect growth when utilizing an emotion-focused coping style compared to those perceived as maladjusted, which can be explained by the affective signaling hypothesis. For individuals with high resilience, intense negative affect can be rapidly experienced, facilitating a timely diagnosis of their mental state. Conversely, for individuals with low resilience, employing emotion-focused coping style did not necessarily amplify their response to negative affect. This suggested that fostering an emotion-focused coping style might be a compelling approach to prepare populations for a potential global surge in mental health issues.
