# Building Resilience Through Exposure To Stressors: The Effects Of Challenges Versus Hindrances

Monique F. Crane and Ben J. Searle Macquarie University This paper explores the potential for certain types of stressors to build resilience in the occupational setting. Using the challenge– hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, & Boudreau, 2000), we propose that challenge stressors have the potential to promote the capacity for resilience, whereas hindrance stressors experienced in the workplace erode resilient functioning. Employing a 2-wave longitudinal design we examined the effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain 3 months later. Two-hundred and 8 working adults (48.1% female) participated in both surveys. Findings indicated that Time 1 challenge stressors had a significant effect on psychological resilience 3 months later (Time 2). In contrast, Time 1 hindrance stressors positively predicted Time 2 strain and negatively predicted psychological resilience. Moreover, resilience mediated the relationship between Time 1 stressors and Time 2 strain. These results demonstrate the potential positive and negative impacts of workplace stressor types on psychological resilience, and provide an exploration of a mechanism through which challenge and hindrance stressors influence well-being. This analysis also investigated the role of resilience in moderating the relationship between hindrances and strain. Some evidence emerged for the moderating role of resilience in the hindrance–strain relationship. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

Keywords: resilience, occupational, challenge– hindrance, strain, job stressors When considering the impacts of stressors and adversity, it is the negative effects that these events have on longer-term mental health and functioning that is often salient. However, recent research is providing some evidence that life stressors may also be an important opportunity for building the capacity for resilience, with downstream benefits to well-being and mental health. Resilience is a term used to describe the capacity to adapt effectively to life adversity with a short-lived downturn in functioning (Bonanno, 2005; Garmezy & Streitman, 1974; Masten, Best, & Garmezy, 1990). Previous work has found that people with some history of lifetime adversity (i.e., two to four events) reported better life satisfaction, lower global distress, lower posttraumatic symptoms and functional impairment compared to those with high or very low levels of lifetime adversity (Seery, Holman, & Silver, 2010). Moreover, people with some lifetime adversity tended to experience less distress as a consequence of recent difficulties, suggesting that people have the capacity for psychological resilience (Seery et al., 2010). Other work also highlights the necessity of opportunities within the environment to shape an individual's capacity to build resilience (Ungar, 2012). Such perspectives move away from an approach to resilience that is focused on what characteristics the individual brings to the situation, but rather also

considers the important role of experiences that can facilitate growth (Ungar, 2012).

This paper explores how certain types of workplace stressors have the potential to enhance the capacity for resilience in the context of the workplace. In particular, we apply the challengehindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, &
Boudreau, 2000; LePine, Podsakoff, & LePine, 2005) to delineate resilience-building stressors from resilience-depleting stressors. As the name suggests, the challenge– hindrance stressor framework distinguishes between two types of stressors: challenge and hindrance stressors. Although hindrance stressors are understood to consistently drain the resources of their recipient, in our model we propose that challenge stressors may have a quality that allows the development of personal capacities (e.g., coping strategies, perceived coping efficacy) that facilitate downstream psychological resilience. In the present study, we explore whether challenge stressors are distinctly related to increasing the capacity for resilience, in contrast to hindrance stressors that are anticipated to deplete resilience. There are two core implications of such an effect. First, rather than just managing or tolerating workplace stressors, particular stressor types may be important opportunities to build capacity for resilience. Second, it implies that resilience is influenced positively and negatively by the work environment and is not just dependent on individual-level characteristics.

We also explore the role of resilience in the relationship between stressors and the downstream strain response. In line with the above, it is proposed that resilience has a mediating role between the stressor types and strain whereby the stressor contributes to either an increase or decrease in resilience that in turn 1 This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

affects the experience of strain. Figure 1 illustrates the key features of the proposed conceptual model.

## The Role Of Stressor Exposure In Nurturing Resilience

Recent research suggests that stressor exposure may contribute to the development of future resilience. While it is widely acknowledged that life adversity has the potential to harm an individual's mental health and wellbeing (e.g., Weiss, Saraceno, Saxena, & van Ommeren, 2003), a person's life history of trauma and adversity exposure has recently been considered a possible factor contributing positively to the development of resilience. In a national U.S. sample, Seery et al. (2010) identified that the relationship between lifetime adversity and global distress, functional impairment and life satisfaction was a quadratic function. Both low and high levels of early life adversity predicted greater global distress, functional impairment, and lower life satisfaction. In contrast, moderate lifetime adversity (i.e., two to four events) yielded more positive outcomes on these three measures. Moreover, exposure to moderate adversity seemed to anticipate better well-being and mental health outcomes in the face of recent life stressors. Seery et al. (2010) suggested that adversity plays an important role in building resilience by developing coping skills, engaging supportive networks and promoting coping efficacy.

Other studies, prior to Seery et al. (2010), also investigated the role of stressor exposure for later well-being and mental health functioning. Schnurr, Rosenberg, and Friedman (1993) measured psychological functioning in Vietnam War veterans pre- and postmilitary deployment. These authors demonstrated that peripheral exposure to combat predicted improvements in psychological functioning, compared to no exposure or direct exposure. Collectively, this previous work suggests the potential for stressors to support resilience building in some capacity.

## How Stressor Type Could Impact Psychological Resilience

Rather than focusing on stressor event frequency, our work examines whether the capacity to build resilience is affected by the stressor type. The proposal that stressor type may be important to psychological outcomes is not new. For example, Selye (1982)

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

Figure 1. Proposed model of challenge– hindrance stressor impact on resilience and strain.
suggested that it may be stressor type, rather than strength, that was critical to determining whether a stressor resulted in good stress or bad stress. However, previous work examining potentially traumatic stressors has provided little evidence that particular trauma types result in particular mental health outcomes. A review by McMahon, Grant, Compas, Thurm, and Ey (2003) considered whether exposure to particular potentially traumatic events (e.g., exposure to violence, abuse) was related to specific psychological outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression). These authors concluded that there was little evidence to suggest that particular stressors result in specific mental health outcomes or classes of outcomes (e.g., externalizing disorders).

Although important, previous research examining adversity typology and specific outcomes has been limited in three central ways. First, researchers have focused on the investigation of poor mental health outcomes, rather than resilience (e.g., Bayatpour, Wells, & Holford, 1992) or related psychological processes that may sustain good functioning in the face of adversity (e.g., coping, stressor appraisal). Second, the categories of stressors investigated by researchers such as McMahon and colleagues (2003) share some key features (e.g., high intensity, potentially traumatic) that may have dominant effects on wellbeing. Broader, theoretically distinct categories of stressors may be more likely to reveal differences. Third, the potentially traumatic events that are the focus of many studies may present less opportunity for resilience building because of their extreme nature. Everyday stressors, such as those that take place in the workplace, may present manageable difficulties that are less likely to overwhelm the coping system, are more likely to directly influence resilience, and can be more easily differentiated into distinct, well-studied categories.

The present research draws from an occupational health model of work-based stressors that delineates two broad categories of everyday workplace stressors. The challenge– hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh et al., 2000; Rodell & Judge, 2009) is one model that may present a useful way of delineating stressors that contribute to the capacity for resilience versus those that erode it. Research distinguishing between challenge and hindrance stressors has demonstrated some evidence that stressor type may have important impacts on good and bad outcomes. Hindrance stressors are demands that tend to be viewed as barriers to goal accomplishment and are therefore considered inhibitory to personal growth
(Cavanaugh et al., 2000). In contrast, challenge stressors are job demands that tend to be viewed as stressors that create an opportunity for personal growth and development (Cavanaugh et al.,
2000). Challenge stressors are considered to also deplete energy leading to exhaustion and stress, but at the same time increase personal capabilities (Van den Broeck, De Cuyper, De Witte, & Vansteenkiste, 2010). This is what Selye (1956) characterized as eustress, the more positive component of stress. The education and training process is perhaps a good example of this dual-action demand. Education and training build one's personal skill base, but they place cognitive demands on learners, and may be emotionally demanding where they highlight the limitations of one's current knowledge or ability. Previous authors readily acknowledge that personal growth and gain is often coupled with the experience of psychological or physical stress (Carver, 1998). The Conservation of Resources Model (Hobfoll, 1989) suggests that although stressful circumstances often result in resource loss, successfully ad-

dressing stressful situations is also likely to enhance resources by promoting an increase in self-esteem, self-efficacy, and adaptive coping. Thus, several theories converge on the notion that stressful challenges can promote personal growth and, ultimately, improved well-being.

The research examining challenge stressors suggests that these stressors are related to a range of positive work-related outcomes. A study of U.S management executives demonstrated that the experience of work stress was related to different work outcomes depending on the type of stressor experienced (Cavanaugh et al.,
2000). Feeling stress associated with challenge stressors was related positively to job satisfaction and less job seeking behaviors.

However, job stress related to hindrance stressors was negatively related to job satisfaction and positively related to job search and voluntary turnover 1 year later (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Similarly, a meta-analysis examining retention-related outcomes found that hindrance stressors had a negative relationship with job satisfaction and organizational commitment and a positive relationship with intention to leave and actual turnover (Podsakoff, LePine, & LePine, 2007). Challenge stressors, on the other hand, related positively to retention, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. A meta-analysis conducted by LePine et al. (2005) found that challenge stressors were positively related to motivation and performance outcomes, whereas hindrance stressors were negatively related to motivation and performance. Moreover, studies demonstrate a robust positive relationship between challenge stressors and motivation and vigor at work (e.g., Van den Broeck et al.,
2010).

Despite the benefits associated with challenge stressors, and contrary to our conceptual model, previous research suggests that both challenge and hindrance stressors contribute to increased psychological strain, such as emotional exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and tension (Boswell, Olson-Buchanan, & LePine, 2004; LePine, LePine, & Jackson, 2004; LePine et al., 2005; Podsakoff et al., 2007). For example, in a cross-sectional study of university support staff (e.g., clerical, computer support), Boswell et al. (2004) found that both challenge and hindrance stressors were positively related to anxiety and emotional exhaustion. In a further cross-sectional study, both hindrance and challenge stressors were again related to exhaustion
(LePine et al., 2004). Meta-analyses conducted (LePine et al., 2005) also find a positive relationship between both forms of work stressors and psychological strain.

Having noted the overall support for a positive relationship between challenge-stressors and strain, a core limitation of studies using the challenge– hindrance framework is that the predominantly cross-sectional designs make it difficult to draw firm conclusions, as both directions of causality are plausible. Certainly, it is reasonable to interpret past findings as demonstrating that both challenge and hindrance stressors have impacts on psychological strain (e.g., Boswell et al., 2004). In fact, eustress anticipates the necessity of the stress experience for positive growth outcomes. However, it is equally likely that employees who presently feel anxious, distressed and emotionally exhausted will perceive higher levels of both stressor types. A core aim of the present study was therefore to use a longitudinal design to investigate relations between challenge and hindrance stressors and strain.

## The Role Of Resilience In The Stressor–Strain Relationship

As noted previously, a secondary aim of this paper is to explore the role of resilience in the stressor–strain relationship. Our conceptual model presented in Figure 1 suggests a mediating role for resilience, whereby challenge and hindrance stressors respectively enhance or diminish resilience, with consequent influences on strain. However, other approaches to the way resilience promotes effective adaptation suggest different roles for resilience. First, reflecting a direct effects model, resilience is considered to promote good mental health outcomes (Davydov, Stewart, Ritchie, &
Chaudieu, 2010), allowing a more generalized effect on positive well-being that reduces the occurrence of psychological dysfunction directly. This might be because the capacities that enable resilience help a person to avoid some negative encounters or encourages positive affectivity. Thus, resilience is able to promote an overall positive effect on well-being and reduce strain irrespective of the stressor frequency or intensity. Second, a moderating role for resilience is also proposed. According to the *harmreduction* approach (Davydov et al., 2010), resilience partially reduces the impact of stressor events on symptomology. The protection approach similarly predicts a moderating role for resilience whereby resilience supports the maintenance of good functioning despite difficulty (Davydov et al., 2010). The difference between the harm-reduction and protection approaches is the level of dysfunction experienced after exposure. According to the harmreduction approach, once an individual has experienced a decline in their well-being, after the onset of a stressor, resilience allows the person to quickly recover or "bounce back" from that strain. The protection approach proposes that no decline in function occurs, and resilience acts like a force field deflecting the impact of potentially stressful experiences. However, these approaches to the role of resilience do not capture the potential for the stressors themselves to impact one's level of resilience in a positive or negative way. Our model suggests a mediating role for resilience whereby challenge and hindrance stressors have a direct impact on resilience, which in turn impacts the experience of strain. Thus, a secondary aim of this paper is to explore the direct, moderating and mediating roles of resilience in the stressor–strain relationship.

## The Present Study

In summary, there are four key aspects of previous research and theory that have led to our present hypotheses. First, stressor exposure appears to have some role in enhancing the capacity for resilience. Second, according to the challenge–
hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh et al., 2000), challenge stressors should function as developmental opportunities that are able to promote personal growth. Third, empirical work consistently demonstrates that challenge stressors are positively related to several aspects of job-related functioning. This is distinct to hindrance stressors that demonstrate a negative relationship to these outcomes. Finally, the cross-sectional design of past research prevents the firm conclusion that challenge stressors result in increased strain. In light of the above, the first aim of this study will be to demonstrate the positive impact of challenge stressors on resilience, and conversely the negative impact of hindrance stressors on resilience.

The following formal predictions are made:
Hypothesis 1: (H1) Challenge stressors will be associated positively with resilience (H1a) and negatively with strain symptoms (H1b) reported 3 months later.

Hypothesis 2: (H2) Hindrance stressors will be associated negatively with resilience (H2a) and positively with strain symptoms (H2b) reported 3 months later.

The second aim of this study will be to examine the role of resilience in the stressor–strain relationship. Three possible roles for psychological resilience will be considered. The first is the direct effect of resilience, consistent with the idea that resilience broadly promotes wellbeing.

Hypothesis 3: (H3) Resilience will be associated negatively with strain symptoms reported 3 months later.

Second, considering this direct effect in conjunction with our previous predictions (H1a/H2a) that stressors will influence personal resilience, we anticipate that resilience will play a mediating role:
Hypothesis 4: (H4) Challenge stressors will be negatively related to strain experienced 3 months later, with the relation being mediated by resilience. T1 challenge stressors will positively predict T2 resilience, which in turn will be negatively related to the experience of strain symptoms.

Hypothesis 5: (H5) Hindrance stressors will be positively related to strain experienced 3 months later, with the relation being mediated by resilience. T1 hindrance stressors will negatively predict T2 resilience, which in turn will be negatively related to the experience of strain symptoms.

Finally, given that previous approaches suggest a moderating role for resilience we will also examine the possible moderating role of resilience in the stressor–strain relationship. In this analysis, we did not set out to directly examine the harm-reduction verses the protection approach to resilience, but to simply determine the possible role for resilience as a moderator. The following prediction is made based on these models:
Hypothesis 6: (H6) The relationship between hindrance stressors and strain will be moderated by resilience. The hindrance stressors will positively predict later strain when resilience is low. However, this relationship will be attenuated or nonsignificant at higher levels of resilience. We did not anticipate an interaction between challenge stressors and resilience because it is proposed (H1b) that challenge stressors to not represent events that engender adversity resulting in strain.

## Method Participants And Design

We used a longitudinal design with two measurement times with a 3-month interval between time points. A 3-month interval was considered appropriate based on a few considerations. Dormann and Griffin (2015) suggest that longitudinal studies utilize relatively short time intervals that are long enough that the measured variables might be reasonably expected to change, but not much longer due to the risk of not capturing the effects of those variables. Furthermore, Dormann and Griffin (2015) recommend conducting pilot studies to test how long it takes for key variables to change. We undertook a pilot study to examine change in resilience over a 2-month period. One hundred and 15 undergraduate psychology students participated in both waves of the study (M age - 20.34; Males - 28.8%). The mean of resilience at Time 1 (M - 4.48; SD - 1.18) was statistically equivalent to Time 2
(M - 4.47; SD - 1.19) (t(114) - .219, p - .834). A 3-month time-frame was long enough to detect change in the variables and short enough to capture relations between them.

Participants were recruited for the study via an Australian online research company. At Time 1, 5,000 invitations were sent to potential participants from the company's databases. Of these, 1,020 clicked on the link; however, only 647 indicated consent and proceeded past the information page. One hundred and 22 participants indicated that they were not currently employed and were therefore restricted from completing the survey. The remaining Time 1 sample was 520 participants, reflecting a Time 1 response rate of 10.4%. Of those 520 cases, 406 indicated consent to being followed up in 3 months and 315 responded to the second data collection. Of those 315 cases, 208 could be matched using a participant-generated survey identification code. This represents a Time 2 response rate of 40% based on the number of Time 1 responses. The final sample of 208 participants (48.1% female) comprised people from all Australian states and territories. Ages ranged from 19 to 76 years old (M - 44.78; SD - 14.19). The mean number of hours worked per week was 32.96 (SD - 13.34) at Time 1 and 32.69 (SD - 13.03) at Time 2.

## Measures

Work stressors. Participants were asked to report the extent to which they had experienced work stressors over the previous 3 months. We used Rodell and Judge's (2009) scale to capture a range of challenge stressors (8 items) and hindrance stressors (8 items). Respondents indicated their response on a 5-point scale from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 5 (*strongly agree*). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that a simple two-factor model did not fit the data well (T1 2(103) - 492.30, p  .001; CFI - .82, TLI - .79, RMSEA - .135, SRMR - .093; T2 2(103) - 509.86, p  .001; CFI - .80, TLI - .76, RMSEA - .138, SRMR - .091).

Using a similar procedure to Tuckey, Searle, Boyd, Winefeld, and Winefeld (2015), we modeled challenges and hindrances as two higher order factors, each indicated by three 2-item subscales.

Challenge subscales were *workload* (e.g., "I've had to work on a large number of projects and/or assignments," T1 - .73, T2 -
.75), *time pressure* (e.g., "I have experienced extreme time pressure in my work," T1 - .92, T2 - .90), and *skill demands* (e.g.,
"my job has required a lot of skill," T1 - .89, T2 - .88).

Hindrance subscales were *role ambiguity* (e.g., "My duties and work objectives have been unclear to me," T1 - .86, T2 - .89),
role conflict (e.g., "I have received conflicting requests from two or more people," T1 - .76, T2 - .79), and organizational constraints (e.g., "I have had many hassles to go through to get projects/assignments done," T1 - .88, T2 - .97). This fit considerably better than the simple two-factor model (T1 2(47) -
91.98, p  .001; CFI - .97, TLI - .96, RMSEA - .068, SRMR -
.051; T2 2(47) - 104.87, p  .001; CFI - .96, TLI - .95, RMSEA - .077, SRMR - .057).

Resilience. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al.,
2008) measures perceptions of one's capacity to bounce back from hardship. The scale consists of six items (e.g., "I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times"). Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which the statements are reflective of their experiences in the previous 3 months on a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (*strongly agree*) (T1 - .90, T2 - .87). CFA
showed that a simple one-factor model did not fit the data well (T1 2(9) - 83.10, p  .001; CFI - .88, TLI - .80, RMSEA - .199, SRMR - .071; T2 2(9) - 101.75, p  .001; CFI - .82, TLI -
.70, RMSEA - .223, SRMR - .100). Modification indices revealed highly correlated error covariances among the positively worded items. To address this issue, resilience was modeled as a higher order factor indicated by the three positively worded items
(one subscale) and three negatively worded items (another subscale). This model fit much better (T1 2(8) - 6.49, p - .592; CFI - 1.00, TLI - 1.01, RMSEA  .001, SRMR - .017; T2 2(47) - 10.44, p - .236; CFI - 1.00, TLI - .99, RMSEA -
.038, SRMR - .018).

Psychological strain. Psychological strain was measured using the stress subscale from the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale
(DASS; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). This is a self-report measure of the core symptoms of stressed emotional states (e.g., "I
found it hard to wind down"). Participants are asked to indicate the degree to which the statements reflected their experiences in the past 2 weeks on a 4-point response scale 0 (*did not apply to me*) to 3 (*applied to me very much*). The DASS-21 has been demonstrated to be a valid measure of adult depression, anxiety and stress in an Australian population (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) and is used extensively in both clinical (Taylor, Lovibond, Nicholas, Cayley,
& Wilson, 2005) and nonclinical groups (Crawford, Cayley, Lovibond, Wilson, & Hartley, 2011). In the current sample, the stress subscale (hereafter referred to as *strain*) had good internal reliability at both time points (T1 - .94, T2 - .94). CFA showed that a simple one-factor model fit the data well (T1 2(14) - 32.23, p - .004; CFI - .96, TLI - .94, RMSEA - .079, SRMR - .033; T2 2(14) - 37.92, p - .001; CFI - .97, TLI - .96, RMSEA -
.091, SRMR - .026).

## Analysis Procedure

In order to investigate the cross-lagged longitudinal analyses, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques using the MPlus (version 6.12) software package. Latent variables were indicated by observed item scores, and in the case of challenge stressors, hindrance stressors, and resilience, higher order latent variables were formed using multiple subscales (latent subfactors) exactly as described in the Method section. Maximum likelihood (MLM) parameter estimates were calculated with standard errors and test statistics that are robust to non-normality.

Models were compared using the Satorra-Bentler test (SB2; Satorra & Bentler, 2010).

Due to the wide range of working hours in the sample, all analyses were repeated using models that included working hours as an additional predictor variable. In no cases did this change the significance status of any effects observed in the original models. Thus, working hours was removed from all final models.

As a preliminary step in the analyses, we tested the measurement model that defines the relations between all observed and unobserved study variables. Measurement models (CFA) specify the pattern by which each measure loads on a particular factor (Byrne, 2010, p. 12). The full CFA measurement model, using all variables from both time points, yielded adequate fit (2(1131) - 2018.96, p  .001; CFI -
.89, TLI - .88, RMSEA - .061, SRMR - .089). Modification indices revealed high levels of error covariance between the T1 and T2 instances of three latent subfactors: skill demands, positive resilience, and role ambiguity. Modeling these three covariances improved model fit (SB2(3)  173.76, p  .001; CFI - .92, TLI - .91, RMSEA - .054, SRMR - .086) and to maximize comparability between models the covariances were modeled in all subsequent analyses.

We then examined competing structural models to investigate the proposed cross-lagged effects: the stability model (M1), which included the autoregressive effects (e.g., causal chains) over time, but did not include any cross-lagged associations; the causal model (M2),
which combined the stability model with the causal relationships hypothesized in H1 and H2; and the reciprocal model (M3), which is the combination of both causal model and reverse model paths.

Next, we ran competing structural models to test hypotheses about the role of resilience in relations between stressors and strain. First, we tested a mediation model (M4) that examined the indirect effects of T1 stressors on T2 strain via T2 resilience. Then we added a moderation effect in a model (M5) that examined the role of T2 resilience in moderating the relationship between T1 stressors and T2 strain, in addition to a mediation effect. To create interaction terms, factor loadings from the above CFA were used to calculate scores for the six stressor subscales and the two resilience subscales, which were all mean-centered at zero before factor loadings were again used to combine them into the two stressor scales and one resilience scale, all with means of zero. Interaction variables were created by multiplying the scores for challenges and resilience as well as the scores for hindrances and resilience.

## Results Preliminary Analyses

A common feature of longitudinal data is respondent attrition.

Of the initial T1 respondents, 47% provided data at T2. In order to determine whether any bias attributable to response attrition was evident for our measures, a series of independent samples t tests were conducted in order to examine evidence of mean differences between responders and nonresponders in the T1 measured variables. All t tests indicated a nonsignificant difference between respondents and nonreturn respondents (resilience: p - .12; hindrance: p - .55; challenge: p - .78; strain: p - .26).

Of the variables used in this analysis, only 0.21% of the data was missing. These cases were missing completely at random according to Little's MCAR test, 2(542) - 582.66, p - .11. Missing cases were replaced using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Enders, 2001). In order to increase the accuracy of predicted values EM was performed on the items for each scale separately for each time point. Missing values replacement allows structural equation modeling to be conducted on a complete dataset.

both time points, and strain at both time points. These findings indicated moderate levels of stability over time, with T1 variables explaining 68 - 80% of the variance in their T2 counterparts. There was a strong positive relationship between the two stressor types within each time point (rT1 - .76, p  .001; rT2 - .76, p  .001),
consistent with the findings of Cavanaugh et al. (2000) and other authors. Consistent with previous research, we also found that higher levels of strain were concurrently associated with more challenge stressors (rT1 - .31, p  .001; rT2 - .31, p  .001) as well as with more hindrance stressors (rT1 - .45, p  .01; rT2 -
.44, p  .001). T1 challenge stressors were not significantly related to T2 resilience, whereas T1 hindrance stressors were related negatively to T2 resilience (r  .25, p.001).

## Longitudinal Analyses: Direct Effects

In the stability model (M1), T2 variables were regressed on their T1 counterparts, a critical precondition for testing lagged effects.

These autoregressive effects were included in all subsequent analyses. In the causal model (M2), we examined whether the data supported causal effects of T1 stressors and resilience on T2 resilience and strain. As shown in Table 2, model M2 fit the data better than the stability model. Figure 2 demonstrates that in model M2 significant lagged paths emerged from T1 challenge stressors to T2 resilience ( - .18, p - .019) as well as from T1 hindrance stressors to T2 levels of both resilience (-.28, p - .003) and strain ( - .28, p - .002). These results supported our prediction that T2 resilience would be enhanced by T1 challenge stressors (H1a) and eroded by T1 hindrance stressors (H2a). Supporting prediction H2b, T1 hindrance stressors predicted greater strain at T2, although there was no evidence that T1 challenge stressors were negatively related to strain (H1b). There was also a significant lagged path from T1 resilience to T2 strain (-.20, p 
.001), consistent with our prediction that higher levels of resilience reduce strain over time (H3).

Model M2 assumes that the effects only occur in the predicted directions. Yet it is possible, for example, that strain levels could affect subsequent resilience or subsequent exposure to stressors. A cross-lagged analysis was conducted to determine whether such effects existed, and if so, their strength relative to the hypothesized effects. This reciprocal model (M3) tested the paths from M2 alongside the lagged effects of T1 resilience on T2 stressors and of T1 strain on T2 stressors and resilience. Despite including these additional paths, the fit (as shown in Table 2) was equivalent to that of M2. Like M2, model M3 revealed significant lagged paths from T1 challenge stressors to T2 resilience ( -
.21, p - .006), from T1 hindrance stressors to T2 resilience
(-.24, p - .007) and strain ( - .26, p - .003), as well as from T1 resilience to T2 strain (-.18, p - .001). As for the reversed paths, T1 resilience was unrelated to T2 challenge and hindrance stressors and T1 strain was unrelated to stressors at T2. Thus, the associations between stressors, resilience and strain were primarily in the predicted directions. The only exception was an effect of T1 strain on T2 resilience
(-.13, p - .020), which indicated that current strain levels may undermine future capacity for resilience. This effect was modeled in subsequent analyses (M4 and M5), although its inclusion did not change the significance of other effects within those analyses.

Next, we tested the hypothesized mediating effect of resilience in relations between stressors and strain (H4/H5). The simplest test (based on Cole & Maxwell, 2003) uses standardized estimates from Model M2 to calculate the product of (a) the lagged effect of T1 stressors on T2 resilience, with (b) the lagged effect of T1 resilience on T2 strain. This approach indicates a mediation effect of -.04 for challenge stressors via resilience to strain, and one of  - .05 for hindrance stressors via resilience to strain. However, this method does not allow significance testing or confidence estimation of these effects.

A new model (M4) was constructed that included autoregressive effects, lagged effects of T1 stressors on T2 resilience and stress, and the effect of T2 resilience on T2 strain. This allowed us to determine the indirect effect of stressors on strain via resilience, estimating confidence intervals using bootstrapping with 1,000 samples (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). In model M4, T2 strain was directly predicted by T2 resilience (-.36, p  .001) and T1 hindrance stressors ( - .17, p - .036) but not by T1 challenge stressors ( - .003, p - .964), suggesting that effects of challenge stressors on strain could be fully mediated by resilience. The indirect effect of challenge stressors on strain via resilience was significant (-.06, 95% CI  .12 to .01, p - .018) and in the predicted direction (H4), with T1 challenge stressors positively related to T2 resilience, which in turn was negatively related to strain. Consistent with prediction (H5), there was also a significant indirect effect of hindrance stressors on strain via resilience ( - .08, 95% CI - .02 to 0.14, p - .012), indicating that hindrance stressors reduce resilience, which in turn leads to increased strain.

Nevertheless, it was possible that as the resilience and strain measures (both arguably self-assessments of functioning) were taken at the same time, common method variance may have inflated associations enough to create the appearance of mediation. To address this possibility, we tested an alternative mediation model (M4a) that included autoregressive effects, effects of T1 stressors on T1 resilience and T2 stress, and the effect of T1 resilience on T2 stress. Model M4a showed that T1 challenge ( - .47, p  .001) and hindrance (-.55, p  .001) stressors were related to T1 resilience, and T1 resilience in turn influenced T2 strain (-.25, p  .001). Indirect effect of stressors on strain via resilience was again significant for challenge stressors
(-.11, 95% CI  .18 to .05, p  .001), consistent with H4, as well as for hindrance stressors ( - .13, 95% CI - .07 to
.20, p  .001), consistent with H5. Together, the mediation analyses all suggest that challenge and hindrance stressors both influence strain indirectly through their effects on resilience.

Having demonstrated the existence of a mediating role for resilience, we examined the anticipated moderating effects. Model M5 was constructed using all the effects from M4 and then adding the hypothesized interaction between T1 hindrance stressors and T2 resilience, and for completeness, the T1 challenge  T2 resilience interaction. As shown in Table 3, model M5 again showed significant effects of T1 challenge and hindrance stressors on T2 resilience ( - .17, p - .013, and -.22, p - .006, respectively), and a significant relation between T2 resilience and T2 strain (-.37, p  .001), resulting in significant indirect effects on T2 strain via T2 resilience of T1 challenge and hindrance stressors (-.06, 95% CI  .11 to .01, p - .019; and  - .08, 95% CI - .02 to 0.15, p - .011, respectively). Unlike model M4, there was no direct effect of hindrance stressors on strain, however in model M5, strain was significantly influenced by an interaction between T1 hindrances and T2 resilience (-.11, p - .043), consistent with H6. As shown in Figure 3, higher levels of T1 hindrance stressors were associated with more T2 strain among people with low T2 resilience, but prior hindrance stressors did not affect the strain levels of those who were high in resilience.

No effect was observed for the Challenge  Resilience interaction.

This significant interaction is consistent with the suggestion that resilience plays a role in moderating the stressor-strain relationship. In this way, individual differences in resilience determine how people react to stressors, specifically hindrances. If this were the case, the same moderation effect for resilience should be observable regardless of whether the interaction utilized resilience at T1 or at T2. To test this explanation, we conducted a similar analysis (model M5a) in which we examined the main, mediating and interactive effects of T1 resilience instead of T2 resilience. Model M5a was constructed using all the effects from M4a and then adding the T1 hindrance  T1 resilience and T1 challenge

T1 resilience interactions. Results were similar to those of Model 4a, but in model M5a neither interaction effect significantly influenced T2 strain (T1 challenge stressors  T1 resilience:  - .03, p - .533; T1 hindrance stressors  T1 resilience -.04, p -
.304). Thus the moderating effect of resilience appeared to be contingent on the timing of its measurement.

## Discussion

The central aims of this study were to examine the differential effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain, as well as to explore the role of the capacity for resilience in the stressor–strain relationship. Taken together the findings support the proposal that challenge stressors may create opportunities for the capacity for resilience, in contrast to hindrance stressors that deplete the capacity for resilience. As predicted, the model demonstrated that higher levels of challenge stressors led to a greater capacity for resilience (H1a), whereas higher levels of hindrance stressors resulted in lower resilient capacity (H2a). Only hindrance stressors positively predicted strain at three months (H2b), whereas challenge stressors did not (inconsistent with H1b). Moreover, consistent with a direct-effects approach, T1 resilience was negatively associated with T2 strain (H3), suggesting that the capacity for resilience has broad positive impacts on psychological functioning. The reverse causal direction was also considered, and indicated that current strain can reduce future capacity for resilience. This reverse finding is unsurprising, given that the items used in the BRS ask the respondent to reflect upon previous coping to evaluate their capacity for resilience. The experience of previous strain may result in the perception of less resilience. Neither T1 strain nor resilience appeared to influence T2 challenge or hindrance stressors.

Consistent with our prediction (H4), T1 challenge stressors influenced T2 strain indirectly via the capacity for resilience.

Resilience also mediated the relationship between hindrance stressors and subsequent strain (H5), with hindrance stressors reducing resilience, which in turn led to increased strain. These findings provide evidence for a mechanism linking stressors to strain via resilience. That is, part of the way that work stressors influence employee well-being is by influencing his or her capacity for resilience, and since different stressors have different impacts on This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

resilience, this has different outcomes for well-being. The finding for challenge stressors in particular is consistent with several models that propose the possible beneficial, resource-enhancing aspects of stress, as captured in the notion of *eustress* (Selye, 1956)
and the Conservation of Resources Model (Hobfoll, 1989).

Moderation analyses examined whether the relationship between stressor types and strain was varied depending on an individual's level of resilient capacity. As anticipated (H6), resilience at T2 moderated the relationship between hindrance stressors at T1 and strain at T2. When T2 resilience was high there was no relationship between previous hindrance stressors and current strain. In contrast, when resilience was low, former hindrance stressors were positively related to current strain. However, T1 resilience failed to moderate the stressor–strain relationship suggesting that the moderating role of resilience depended on the time it was measured. Thus, the present study observed three distinct roles for the capacity for resilience: a direct effect on strain, a mediator of stressor-strain relations, and a moderator of stressor– strain relations.

Results of the moderation tests can be interpreted in several ways. First, as some have suggested (see Davydov et al., 2010 for review), a stable, dispositional form of resilience may serve a protective or harm-reduction function. However, our findings demonstrated some change in resilience levels over time, which when combined with the absence of a moderating effect for T1 resilience reveals problems with this interpretation. If perceived resilience was a moderator of the hindrance stressor–strain relationship then T1 resilience should also have had a moderating role. It is plausible to expect that one's level of resilience when experiencing the stressor to be critical to resulting strain.

A second possibility is that a lack of current capacity for resilience makes one vulnerable to the effects of past hindrances. This explanation is different from the direct effect of resilience on strain (observed alongside the moderation effect), and it may mean that when resilience decreases this weakens your capacity to cope with current and future stressors (direct effect), while also reducing your capacity to cope with past stressors. If true, this suggests that hindrance stressors cause ongoing effects on well-being that may not manifest as symptoms unless or until resilience is sufficiently low. One final possible explanation is that the resilience acquired following recent stressors helped people bounce back from the hindrances they experienced 3 months prior. This is consistent with the notion that successfully overcoming stressors will enhance coping resources (Hobfoll, 1989). While plausible, a complication with this explanation is that our results suggest that while challenges may increase the capacity for resilience, hindrances tend to reduce resilience. Thus, it would suggest that the capacity for resilience gained through dealing with challenges helps people in handling the strain caused by hindrances, and there is no learning adaptation associated with experiencing hindrances.

These possibilities all require further investigation to better understand which best represents the moderating role of resilience in stressor–strain relations.

Taken together, the findings make the following contributions.

First, this study clarifies the impact of challenge stressors on strain. We have shown in a longitudinal design that, in contrast to the findings of cross-sectional research, challenge stressors do not appear to directly impact on strain 3 months later. Second, we have demonstrated that challenge and hindrance stressors impact strain, at least in part, via their influence on the capacity for resilience.

This means that interventions designed to improve employee wellbeing should not simply consider the nature of stressors present in a workplace, but should also consider employee resilience as a critical variable. Third, we have demonstrated that resilience plays three distinct roles in relations between stressors and strain: direct, moderating, and mediating. Focusing on the mediating role, resilience appears to be malleable and influenced in both positive and negative ways by exposure to stressors. Therefore, it may be possible to better utilize experiences with stressors to develop employee resilience, rather than simply using top-down strategies (such as job redesign; Searle & Parker, 2013) to help employees manage stress. For example, a manager may be able to reframe the meaning of stressors to increase the degree the stressor is perceived as a challenge, or what valued outcome might be gained as a consequence of stressor engagement. By doing this, stressor engagement may become an opportunity for building resilience.

## Whatever Challenges Us...Makes Us More Resilient

Evidence from this analysis suggests that challenge stressors may have the capacity to build resilience. This finding is somewhat inconsistent with the current scholarship that suggests challenge stressors contribute to negative mental health outcomes (Boswell et al., 2004; LePine et al., 2004, 2005; Podsakoff et al., 2007). Yet, the current findings are consistent with research suggesting that challenge stressors are positively related to a myriad of positive job-related factors (e.g., engagement and motivation; e.g., LePine et al., 2005).

Authors examining the challenge– hindrance framework in the context of mental health have interpreted previous findings to indicate that challenge stressors, while they have some benefits, are nevertheless responsible for the experience of strain. We suggest that this view be reconsidered. It is likely that previous findings from cross-sectional data, demonstrating a positive relationship between challenge stressors and psychological strain, is either a result of stressed employees overreporting exposure to all stressors, or the strain caused by challenge stressors is short-lived. As in previous research, the present study found that within the Time 1 cross-sectional data both forms of stressors had a positive relationship to strain. However, when observing these relationships longitudinally it was clear that only hindrance stressors impacted strain 3 months later. The lack of effect of challenge stressors on strain may reflect either the different effects of different challenges (as even longitudinal studies tend to observe negative effects on well-being if they only focus on workload, e.g., Lin, Siu, Shi, & Bai, 2009), and related issues, such as the potential for challenge stressors to be interpreted negatively.

When interpreting the demonstrated negative relationship between hindrance stressors and resilience it is worth reflecting on the traumatic stress literature and posttraumatic growth. Hindrance stressors demonstrate a relationship to increased strain and reduction in resilience, the same can be said of traumatic stressors. Yet, traumatic stressors have demonstrated the potential to build resilience (Seery et al., 2010). Just as traumatic experiences are able to enhance resilience, it could be possible for hindrance stressors to do the same under the right conditions. One condition that allows the potential for difficult experiences to be converted into adaptive outcomes is the meaning applied to such events. Potentially traumatic events are often personally significant and therefore may be more likely to lend themselves to the pursuit for meaning or a "silver-lining." Previous models of adjustment following loss and trauma have emphasized the role finding meaning can play (Park & Cohen, 1993; Taylor, 1983; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). In contrast, hindrance stressors are perhaps less likely to spontaneously encourage the meaning making process in the same way challenge stressors or potentially traumatic events do. Such meaning making may need to be stimulated by external forces, such as a manager who is able to reframe hindrance stressors in a way that is meaningful to employees.

Resource enhancement may be another mechanism by which challenge stressors promote resilience. Studies examining stressor exposure and well-being have suggested that exposure to a small number of life adversities perhaps gives us the opportunity to learn coping skills that promote perceptions of control and mastery
(Seery et al., 2010). This idea is also encompassed by the Conservation of Resources model (Hobfoll, 1989), which proposes that engaging with stressors may positively enhance resources. Perhaps challenge stressors, and potentially traumatic events, are more likely to yield an enhancement of one's resources, whereas resource gain is not often an outcome of hindrance stressors. While the present study suggests that it may be engagement with challenge stressors that enhances resources, it is not yet clear how challenge stressors can lead to increased resilience, or whether the same mechanisms be applied to other forms of stressors.

One potential mechanism is via the *appraisal process*, whereby situations or events may be seen to have potential for future gain or loss. A core tenet of the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, 1987) is that the same stressor can be appraised differently by different people. Appraisal of stressors, rather than just stressor type, is thought to be critical for long-term well-being since it can influence emotional and behavioral responses to stress. Recent research (Searle & Auton, 2015; Webster, Beehr, & Love, 2011) suggests that even though challenge stressors are likely to be appraised positively (i.e., as opportunities for mastery or personal growth), and hindrances stressors are likely to be appraised negatively, there is nevertheless much variation between people in how stressors are appraised. For example, Searle and Auton (2015) found that challenge appraisals mediated effects of time pressure on activated positive affect (e.g.,
excitement) and problem-focused coping, whereas hindrance appraisals mediated effects of time pressure on anger and venting. Searle and Auton's (2015) study suggests a critical role for appraisal in the relationship between stressors and coping outcomes.

Other investigations also need to examine the variation in appraisal for other types of stressors, particularly hindrance stressors, and the role that appraisals play in coping outcomes for a variety of stressor types.

A second possible mechanism is the impact of effectively resolving problems. People who effectively solve their problems and have affirming experiences in the face of stressors may find an increase in psychological resources as well as acquiring valuable knowledge. There is some empirical evidence to support this proposal. Thoits (1994) found that individuals who successfully resolved their job and romantic relationship problems tended to experience an increase in mastery and self-efficacy, compared to those who did not attempt to solve their problems or who made failed attempts to solve their problems. People who did not attempt to solve their problems or experienced failed attempts demonstrated a decline in mastery and self-efficacy. Compared to hindrance stressors, challenge stressors may encourage positive problem-solving experiences. Challenge stressors may elicit greater attempts at problem-solving behavior either directly or via challenge appraisal (as shown by Searle & Auton, 2015). Hindrance stressors, on the other hand, may yield more failed problem-solving, precluding positive learning experiences or the development of coping resources.

## Implications For The Workplace

The results of this study have several implications for the workplace, particularly the finding that the capacity for resilience can be modified by workplace experiences in a relatively short period of time. One obvious implication is that if the workplace is able to provide exposure to challenge stressors there is greater opportunity for the development of resilience and, therefore, reduced work-related strain. This supports Ungar's (2012) proposal that resilience is not just about individual-level capacities, but an interaction between individual characteristics and opportunities for resilience building allowed by the environment. However, one should still be mindful of the possibility that too-frequent challenge stressors that overwhelm the coping system may still emerge in psychological strain. Moreover, processes to select resilient employees may be limited because the work environment is likely to have both positive and negative impacts on resilience, potentially modifying resilience gradually over time. A second implication is the possible role of managers in facilitating resilience by managing the meaning of occupational stressors. The management of meaning is an important role for managers and relates to the ability of managers to influence the meaning of workplace goals (Piccolo & Colquitt, 2006; Smircich & Morgan, 1982). Managers may be able to influence the appraisal of hindrance stressors as a challenge by communicating to employees the potential for stressors to build capabilities. However, the capacity for the appraisal process to impact the outcomes resulting from challenge– hindrance stressors is an important area of future research.

## Limitations And Future Directions

One of the limitations of the present research is that the mediation was examined with only two time points. Although the procedures outlined by Cole and Maxwell (2003) for examining mediation in two-wave longitudinal designs were employed, failing to test a mediation with three waves of data still presents problems for examining complete mediation. Having noted this, mediation was examined in several ways, each yielding similar results.

Another potential limitation of this study is the measure of psychological resilience. The BRS (Smith et al., 2008) involves self-reported reflection on previous coping ability. These retrospective reports rely on a participant's memory of psychological outcomes before and after stressor events (Crane et al., 2012). Having noted this, previous analysis examining the quality of available resilience measures indicates that the BRS is among the highest rating scales when assessed against several criteria (Windle, Bennett, & Noyes, 2011). Moreover, in the present study the scale demonstrated predictive validity, associated with lowered strain 3 months later. Thus, while self-reported resilience is not ideal, the internally consistent results for strain is further validation that participant's where experiencing greater tolerance to particular stressor types. A second limitation of this measure is that it does little to inform the mechanisms that contribute to the link between challenge stressors and resilience. The present research has demonstrated that certain stressor types are able to enhance the capacity for resilience, but why this happens is an open question to be addressed by future research.

Replication of this study with a three-wave design would be useful given the limitation of two-wave designs for complete tests of mediation. This study should also be extended to examine the role of stressor appraisals in building resilience (e.g., appraising a stressor as a challenge, threat or goal obstructing). Future empirical work should examine the role of stressor appraisal in predicting resilience over and above the preassigned stressor categories designated in the challenge– hindrance stressor framework. However, investigators need to be mindful of the challenge– hindrance scale used. Research that seeks to investigate the role of the appraisal process in the stressor-strain relationship will need to use a measure of challenge– hindrance stressors that does not entangle the experience of stressors with the experience of strain (e.g., Boswell et al., 2004; Cavanaugh et al., 2000). Rodell and Judge's (2009) scale of work stressors used in the present study allowed us to separate exposure to stressors from the experience of strain outcomes. Such a scale should be used in future investigations to determine whether the appraisal of stressors is more critical than preassigned stressor categories to strain and resilience outcomes. Given the moderate levels of hindrance stressors observed in the present study, attention should be given to samples or stressors where high levels of adversity are evident. Future examinations attempting to unpack the mechanisms leading from stressor exposure to resilience could also examine the role meaning making
(e.g., benefit of stressor, lessons learnt) plays in this process. Consideration could also be given to the resources developed as a consequence of stressor exposure, such as a sense of mastery or skill development.

As noted previously, managers and other professional support staff may be able to build employee resilience by assisting employees to appraise the work stressors they encounter in more adaptive ways (e.g., by helping employees find meaning in stressors). Importantly, this would assist people not only by preventing some of the negative outcomes of adversity, but also by helping them to benefit from their experience of adversity in terms of building greater resilience. Finally, this study should be replicated using other measures of resilience, such as where mental health and well-being is measured before and then after a stressor event. Examining an individual's trajectory pre and post stressor events allow a measure of actual, rather than perceived resilience.

## Conclusion

This article set out to examine the differential impact of challenge and hindrance stressors on strain and resilience. Importantly, rather than just managing or tolerating workplace stressors, we wished to examine whether particular stressor types may be important opportunities for building resilience in employees. We demonstrated that the influence of challenge stressors on wellbeing was quite distinct to that of hindrance stressors. Hindrance stressors evoked increased strain and reduced resilience, whereas challenge stressors appeared to build resilience. The mediation analyses also provided evidence of a mechanism linking stressors to wellbeing via resilience. Finally, this investigation has integrated the examination of resilience with work-stress research via a thorough investigation of the role of resilience in the relationship between workplace stressors and strain. Future research should seek to extend the present work by exploring the possible mechanisms by which challenge stressors enhance resilience via longitudinal research designs.
