## Abstract

Few studies have investigated stress in association with social and process smartphone use and how these types of use influence problematic smartphone use during the COVID-19 pandemic; furthermore, the moderation effects of resilience have been rarely tested in this model. For these, a cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 766 Chinese undergraduate students (74.4% female; M = 20.1 years, SD = 1.15) who were measured with their levels of stress, academic burnout, smartphone use types (social/process smartphone use), resilience, and problematic smartphone use. Based on the I-PACE theory, we built a structural equation model, and the results indicated that compared with social smartphone use, process smartphone use more related to problematic smartphone use; academic burnout fully mediated between stress and process smartphone use, and between stress and problematic smartphone use. Moreover, resilience moderated between stress and academic burnout, between academic burnout and process smartphone use, and between academic burnout and problematic smartphone use. We discuss the process smartphone use as a key indicator of problematic smartphone use and the role of academic burnout for linking stress and smartphone use behaviors. In addition, interventions for enhancing resilience should be launched in the future. 

## 1. **Introduction**

The multi-functional smartphone is ubiquitous in people's life. As of June 2021, the number of smartphone internet users in China has reached 100.7 million (The 48th China Statistical Report on Internet Development, 2021). The smartphone provides instant contact and enhances productivity (Leftheriotis and Giannakos, 2014; Wu et al., 2021); 
however, the negative influences due to its excessive use have also been noted in literature. Problematic smartphone use describes the maladaptive smartphone use which poses impairments on the user (Billieux et al., 2008; Takao et al., 2009). Resembling behavioral addictions in symptoms though (De-Sola Guti´errez et al., 2016a), problematic smartphone use has yet been officially listed in either DSM-5 or ICD-11. 

Accordingly, we used the term "problematic smartphone use" in this study. 

Problematic smartphone use relates to negative health outcomes. 

The physical impairments involve sleep disorder (Hughes and Burke, 2018; Yang et al., 2020), hand dysfunction (˙INal et al., 2015), and

shoulder pain (Alsalameh et al., 2019). Additional more documented effects are depression, anxiety/social anxiety (Bratu, 2019; Kliestik et al., 2020; Lazaroiu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020), loneliness (Taghizadeh et al., 2019) and lower self-esteem (Wang and Lei, 2021); 
meanwhile, these psychiatric symptoms reversely prompt the individuals to overuse the smartphones (Adams et al., 2020; Green et al., 
2020; Scott et al., 2020; Taylor et al., 2020). In the school setting, students overly using smartphones for non-academic purposes are distracted from their academic work (Troll et al., 2021) and procrastinate in finishing the assignments (Hammoudi et al., 2021). Therefore, there has been a call to investigate the antecedents of problematic smartphone use and the underlying mechanisms contributing to its occurrence. 

Another line of research focuses on stress. Stress arises with the loss of resources that could be caused by the abrupt changes in the circumstances (Hobfoll, 1989; Hobfoll et al., 2018). The contagion of COVID-19 and the related home quarantine have interrupted the supply of life necessities, and this gives rise to the higher stress level (Brooks et al., 
2020; Qiu et al., 2020). As suggested by the general strain theory (Agnew, 1992, 2001), people might fall into the maladaptive behaviors as a coping strategy to escape the negative experiences caused by stress. Following this, some studies reported that stress led to substance abuse (Andersen, 2019) and problematic internet use (Song and Park, 2019). Other researchers extended the research scope and found that stress positively influenced problematic smartphone use (Cho et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018). However, despite the extant findings, few studies have investigated how stress contributes to the noted higher frequency of smartphone use during the COVID-19 pandemic (The 48th China Statistical Report on Internet Development, 2021), and less has been known regarding the mediation and the moderation effects underlying this relation. 

A relevant construct is academic burnout. Academic burnout derives from the study of job burnout and is characterized with symptoms of emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic inefficacy (Dyrbye et al., 
2006, 2009, 2014). Academic burnout results from the constant exposure to pressures in the school setting (Allen et al., 2020; Lin and Huang, 2014) and leads to the decline in academic performance and the negative emotions of depression and anxiety (Cheng et al., 2020; Wei et al., 
2021). In addition, students with academic burnout are also observed with the deficit of self-control (Seibert et al., 2016); therefore, these people would easily depend on problematic behaviors to drive away the bothering symptoms (Jackson et al., 2016; Kristanto et al., 2016). This is supported by that students with academic burnout tend to overuse the smartphones (Hao et al., 2021; Walburg et al., 2016). 

The types of smartphone use are classified into social smartphone use and process smartphone use (Song et al., 2004). Social smartphone use refers to the use for social interactions such as phone calls, text, and WeChat messaging; process smartphone use focuses on the entertainment functions, including news consumption, entertainment and relaxation (van Deursen et al., 2015). Some researchers found that people with stress were motivated to use smartphones for entertainment or escapism purposes and thus, this resulted in more process smartphone use (van Deursen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Other studies then pointed out it was the psychopathologies that influenced an individual's smartphone use behavior. People experiencing depressive symptoms tend to avoid social smartphone use (Elhai et al., 2017; Panova et al., 2020) while those with anxiety increase process smartphone use (Elhai et al., 2017; Rozgonjuk et al., 2018). Furthermore, academic burnout relates to both social and process smartphone use. Walburg et al. (2016) 
found that academic burnout was associated with the higher frequency of Facebook use. Another study involving Chinese undergraduates reported the positive association between academic burnout symptoms and more smartphone gaming (Wang et al., 2007). Studies on the correlations between smartphone use types and problematic smartphone use have yielded mixed findings. Some researchers found that phone calling and the motivation to maintain social circle predicted the excessive smartphone use (Khang et al., 2013; Takao et al., 2009). Then, Lopez-Fernandez et al. (2014) supported this by that social smartphone use not the process smartphone use was more popular in adolescent problematic smartphone users. However, other studies revealed the opposite result that process smartphone use was an indicator of problematic smartphone use (Elhai et al., 2017; van Deursen et al., 2015). 

Therefore, more recent studies are needed to clarify these relations. 

Considering the impacts of the pandemic in reshaping people's smartphone use behaviors, investigating the social/process smartphone use and their mediation effects in contributing to the association between the psychiatric symptom and problematic smartphone use would broaden the understanding of the relations among these constructs. 

Resilience describes the psychological quality to withstand and bounce back from life adversities (Bonanno, 2004; Herrman et al., 2011; Rutter, 1987). Resilient individuals perceive the nature of the encountered stressor and are well prepared to handle the entailing negative influences on mental health (Anyan and Hjemdal, 2016; Wang et al., 
2019). Therefore, students as such have fewer academic burnout symptoms (Gong et al., 2021; Ríos-Risquez et al., 2016). In addition, resilience generates positive coping style and keeps off problematic behaviors (Ali et al., 2010; Sanchez et al., 2021). There is a study reporting that resilience prevents college students from falling into excessive social networking site use (Hou et al., 2017). Another study by Yen et al. (2019) observed that resilience helped young adults with depression to refrain from internet gaming. 

A widely applied theory for explaining the development of problematic smartphone use is the Interaction of Person-Affect-CognitiveExecution model (I-PACE) (Brand et al., 2016, 2019). I-PACE model proposes the predisposing factors of problematic smartphone use including personal core characteristics, psychopathology, environmental factors, and using motives, etc. This model also suggests the detailed mechanism that the predisposing factors would intrigue the affective and cognitive responses within an individual and then these determinants combined decide the choice of specific smartphone use and in turn, influence the problematic smartphone use. The affective/cognitive response variable is conceptualized as the mediator between the predisposing factor and the smartphone use behaviors. 

Hypotheses: 
There are evidences to support both social and process smartphone use could result in the excessive smartphone use (Elhai et al., 2017; Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014). We aimed to test this under the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore, we hypothesized: H1. Both social and process smartphone use should positively predict problematic smartphone use. 

According to the I-PACE model (Brand et al., 2016, 2019), the affective/cognitive response variable should mediate between the personal core characteristic and the smartphone use behaviors. In our study, we hypothesized stress as the personal core characteristic, academic burnout as the affective/cognitive response; therefore, we hypothesized: 
H2. Academic burnout should fully mediate relations between stress and social/process smartphone use and between stress and problematic smartphone use. 

This study extended the frame work proposed by the I-PACE model. 

Given the effects of resilience for attenuating the impacts of stress on psychopathological symptom (Barzilay et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019) 
and given the effects of resilience for refraining the emerging of problematic behaviors (Sanchez et al., 2021; Yen et al., 2019), we hypothesized resilience should moderate the path from stress to problematic smartphone use. H3. Resilience should moderate between stress and academic burnout, between academic burnout and social/process smartphone use, between academic burnout and problematic smartphone use, and between social/process smartphone use and problematic smartphone use. 

All the proposed hypotheses were depicted in Fig. 1.

## 2. **Methods** 2.1. Participants And Procedure

The participants were recruited from three universities in Northeast China by the method of stratified random sampling. For the diversity of the participants, the selected universities are different in their levels of admission requirements and all the students enrolled are registered Chinese undergraduate students (age ≥17) and have various disciplines including music, kindergarten education, language teaching, computer science, chemistry, math, and mechanical engineering, etc. The online cross-sectional survey took place in middle March 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all the students experienced home quarantine and continued their education via online teaching. Self-reported questionnaires were stored in a website (https://www.wjx.cn/), an online platform widely used for collecting questionnaires in China. The link was forwarded to the participants at the end of the online classes via QQ and WeChat groups. A total of 834 students joined in the survey and 766 responded with valid answers (resulting in the response rate 91.84%). 

The average age of the participants was 20.1 years (SD = 1.15). More female students (n = 570, 74.4%) joined in the survey than male students (n = 196, 25.6%). The survey was approved by the Ethics Committee of the authors' institutions and the written consent was obtained from each participant. The Declaration of Helsinki principles were followed in the study. 

## 2.2. Measures

2.2.1. *Smartphone addiction scale-short version (SAS-SV)* 
We used the smartphone addiction scale-short version (SAS-SV) 
(Kwon et al., 2013) to measure the severity of problematic smartphone use of the participants. It consists of 10 items and runs on a 6-point Likert system ranging from "1 = strongly disagree" to "6 = strongly agree". 

Samples items include e.g., "Missing planned work due to smartphone use" and "Having a hard time concentrating in class, while doing assignments, or while working due to smartphone use". SAS-SV has been widely used and proved with great reliability (Elhai et al., 2020b; 2020c). The Cronbach's alpha in the current sample was .813. 

## 2.2.2. Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (Dass-21)

As suggested by previous studies (Gao et al., 2018; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995), we used the stress subscale of DASS-21 to measure the level of stress. This subscale has 7 items and is based on a 4 point-Likert system ranging from "0 = did not apply to me" to "3 = applied to me very much". Sample items include e.g., "I found it hard to wind down" and "I tended to over-react to situations". The Cronbach's alpha of stress subscale in the current sample was .833. 

## 2.2.3. Learning Burnout Scale (Lbs)

The participants' levels of academic burnout were measured by Learning Burnout Scale (Lian et al., 2015) which was revised on the basis of Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach et al., 2001). The scale consists of 20 items and runs on a 5-point Likert system ranging from "1 =
strongly disagree" to "5 = strongly agree". Sample items include e.g., "I 
seldom study after school" and "I feel exhausted when studying". It has been widely used and proved with good validity (Li et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2015). The Cronbach's alpha in the current sample was .862. 

## 2.2.4. Social And Process Smartphone Use

Two scales developed previously were used to measure social and process smartphone use (van Deursen et al., 2015). The social smartphone use scale includes 5 items and the process smartphone use scale includes 7 items. Sample items include e.g., "I use my smartphone to interact with people" (social smartphone use) and "I use my smartphone in order to escape from real-life" (process smartphone use). Both scales were based on a 5-point Likert system ranging from "1 = strongly disagree" to "5 = strongly agree". The Cronbach's alphas for social and process smartphone use were 0.837 and 0.745 respectively. 2.2.5. *The Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC)* 
The CD-RISC (Connor and Davidson, 2003) includes 25 items and runs on a 5-point Likert system, ranging from "0 = not true at all" to "4 = true nearly all the time". The questionnaire has been widely used for measuring resilience among Chinese population with good validity 
(Chen et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2016). The Cronbach's alpha in the current sample was .93. 

## 2.3. Data Analyses

2.3.1. *Statistical analyses* We used SPSS 22 for preliminary test and the significance level was set at 0.05. We calculated the medians and the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data. Wilconxon Mann-Whitney test was used to check the possible differences in the levels of stress, academic burnout, social/ 
process smartphone use, resilience, and problematic smartphone use among the male and female participants. We conducted the Spearman analysis to investigate the correlations among the investigated variables by using the total score of each variable. 

We used Mplus 7.0 (Muth´en and Muth´en, 1998) for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the structural equation modeling analyses. We modeled confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of each investigated variable using item level data. The items were treated as ordinal, and we used polychoric covariance matrices, weighted least squares estimation with a mean and variance adjusted chi-square (WLSMV), and probit-based factor loadings (DiStefano and Morgan, 2014). Residual covariances were fixed to zero; all factor loadings were freely estimated, with factor variances fixed to a value of 1. Good model fit was judged based on the model fit indices which have thresholds of >0.90 for comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), <0.06 for root mean squared residual (RMSEA) and <0.08 for standardized root mean residual (SRMR) (Hu and Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2011). The results of CFA showed that academic burnout, social smartphone use, process smartphone use, resilience resulted in poor fit while stress and problematic smartphone use exhibit good model fit. To preserve the statistical power, we followed the analysis methods in previous studies (Elhai et al., 2020a, 2020b; Hall et al., 2017), and modeled academic burnout, social/process smartphone use, resilience as observed variables, and stress and problematic smartphone use as latent variables in the SEM 
analyses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using Mplus 7.0 (Muth´en and Muth´en, 1998) was used to test the hypothesized mediation model by generating bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval (using 5000 bootstrapping samples). We added resilience to the obtained mediation model by SEM using Mplus 7.0 (Muth´en and Muth´en, 1998) to test the moderation effects. 

## 2.3.2. Control Variables

Given the differences of age and gender in problematic smartphone use (Chen and Chung, 2016; De-Sola Guti´errez et al., 2016b; Hao et al., 
2019), age and gender were treated as control variables in this study. 

## 3. **Results**

3.1. *Testing for the differences in the participants' gender* The results of the Wilconxon Mann-Whitney test indicated that male students showed significantly higher levels in stress, academic burnout and process smartphone use. No significant difference was observed in other variables (see Table 1).

burnout, process smartphone use and problematic smartphone use while negatively to social smartphone use and resilience. Problematic smartphone use was in significant positive association with process smartphone use and in negative association with social smartphone use (see Table 2). 

## 3.3. Sem Results 3.3.1. Testing For The Mediation Model

The mediation model showed adequate model fit: CFI = 0.901; TLI =
0.881; SRMR = 0.069 and RMSEA = 0.067 (90% confidence interval =
0.061, 0.073). Standardized coefficients are presented in Fig. 2. After controlling for age and gender, problematic smartphone use was significantly associated with process smartphone use (t = 5.553, p = .000) not social smartphone use (t = 1.019, p = .308). Academic burnout significantly mediated between stress and problematic smartphone use 
(β = 0.074, 95% confidence interval 0.046 to 0.117); and between stress and process smartphone use (β = 0.287, 95% confidence interval 0.058 to 0.553) (see Table 3). 

## 3.3.2. Testing For The Moderation Effects

The results of the moderation tests indicated that the interaction between resilience and stress had a significant effect on academic burnout: with a higher level of resilience, the positive association between stress and academic burnout became less positive (stress ×
resilience, β = 0.131, p<.01). Namely resilience significantly moderated the impact of stress on academic burnout. The interaction of academic burnout and resilience had a significant effect on process smartphone use: with a higher level of resilience, the positive association between academic burnout and process smartphone use became less positive (academic burnout × resilience, β = 0.003, p = .01). Namely resilience significantly moderated the impact of academic burnout on process smartphone use. The interaction of academic burnout and resilience had a significant effect on problematic smartphone use: with a higher level of resilience, the positive association between academic burnout and problematic smartphone use became less positive (academic burnout × resilience, β = 0.001, p<.001). Namely resilience significantly moderated the impact of academic burnout on problematic smartphone use. However, we did not observe the moderation effect of

resilience on the path between process smartphone use and problematic smartphone use (process smartphone use × resilience, β = 0.001, p =
.119) (see Table 4). The coefficients were depicted in Fig. 3. 

## 4. **Discussion**

We first discovered the gender differences in stress, academic burnout, and process smartphone use among the participants. Male students were observed with the higher levels of stress and academic burnout, which are the opposites of previous findings (Graves et al., 2021; Nebhinani et al., 2021). The pandemic related social distancing and home quarantine have shrunk the life circles and these sudden changes have been rarely experienced by the young adults. Therefore, the entailing influences could be more likely observed among the males who are more energetic and have higher basic psychological needs of autonomy and competence (Abidin et al., 2021; Navarro-Paton ´ et al., 
2018). According to the self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 1985), the inadequate satisfaction with psychological needs would contribute to the higher stress level of the afflicted individuals (Lombas and Esteban, 2018; Novak et al., 2021). The higher level of stress leads to the more symptoms of academic burnout among the males (Yusoff et al., 
2021). Following the I-PACE model (Brand et al., 2016, 2019), male students with the exceeding academic burnout symptoms tend to conduct more process smartphone use to relieve the induced negative emotions.

Partially supporting H1, we observed only the process smartphone use significantly related to problematic smartphone use. This supports the previous finding obtained prior the pandemic that problematic smartphone use more relates to the process smartphone use (Elhai et al., 2017, 2020a). The process smartphone use brings enjoyment and this pleasurable experience might easily lead to the decreased control over the behavior (Meng et al., 2020). This scenario sustains and is even strengthened during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the temporary emotional relief, the distressed people might repeat the process smartphone use; however, when this behavior grows out of control, it enhances the chance of problematic smartphone use. Although the use for social purpose also influences the excessive smartphone use before the pandemic (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Blau, 2016), the background is different in that the home quarantine brings more family time. Enjoying the company of families, students conduct less social smartphone use than when they are in the campus away from home. This concurs with the statistics that the percentage of smartphone use for instant communication slightly dropped from March to June 2020 in China (The 48th China Statistical Report on Internet Development, 2021). 

Partially supporting H2, academic burnout mediated relations between stress and process smartphone use and between stress and problematic smartphone use. Stress significantly correlated with academic burnout, and academic burnout related to process smartphone use and problematic smartphone use. Academic burnout represents as the affective/cognitive response to the stress endured by the quarantined students (Gundogan, 2022; Sveinsdottir ´ et al., 2021). As discussed in the I-PACE model (Brand et al., 2016, 2019), the affective/cognitive response serves as a mediator between the personal core characteristic and the smartphone use behaviors. In this sense, students living under the stressful condition during the pandemic would easily develop academic burnout symptoms (Allen et al., 2020; Kilic et al., 2021), and then, the distressed students depend on the process and even the uncontrollably excessive smartphone use to release the negative feelings 
(Elhai et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2021). 

Partially supporting H3, we observed resilience moderated the paths between stress and academic burnout, between academic burnout and process smartphone use, and between academic burnout and problematic smartphone use. These are in line with previous findings (Cheng et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2019; Robertson et al., 2018; Yen et al., 2019) and offer a comprehensive understanding of the role of resilience for enhancing psychological wellbeing. The results revealed that resilience moderated between stress and academic burnout and this could be explained by that resilience strengthens an individual by gathering adequate resources to endure the tough situations (Barzilay et al., 2020; Labrague and Santos, 2020). With sufficient supports, a student stays focused on the study and is less likely disturbed by the uncertainties in the circumstances, which keeps off the academic burnout (Gong et al., 2021). Besides, resilience also moderated between academic burnout and process smartphone use and between academic burnout and problematic smartphone use respectively. Resilience is a personality trait as well as a skill which enables a person with the insights of the tough situation and the high tolerance of negative emotions 
(Barzilay et al., 2020). In this way, when a student is subject to academic burnout, resilience could help to get rid of these symptoms in good time and pull this person back to the normal track (Cheng et al., 2020). This would keep the student away from depending on the process smartphone use for relief and effectively reduce the chance of problematic smartphone use (Hao et al., 2021; Shen, 2020). 

## 4.1. Limitations And Implications

We acknowledge several limitations to be addressed. First, the current cross-sectional study could not draw causalities from the statistical relationships; therefore, longitudinal design is called for in the future to clarify the relations of the investigated variables. Second, the scales used in this study for measuring the social and process smartphone use focused on the limited smartphone use types and we acknowledge that the current classification of social and the process smartphone use could have some overlaps. This might impact the results. The smartphones are evolving so fast, and many new types of use are added to the devices. 

Hence, future studies should cover more specific use types especially considering the extended contexts requesting smartphone uses. Third, the study only involved the undergraduate students from one region of the country and the results could not represent the whole population. In addition, most of the sample is comprised of female students, which might influence the results of the Wilconxon Mann-Whitney test. However, the large sample could to some degree supports the robustness of the study. 

The current study has several implications. First, despite the extant findings (Elhai et al., 2017, 2020a; Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014; van Deursen et al., 2015), our study discusses the associations between smartphone use types and problematic smartphone use with the data obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings consolidate the understanding that process smartphone use is a stable indicator of problematic smartphone use. This is an interesting finding considering that the adjustments to the pandemic have reshaped people's habits of smartphone use (Jakhar et al., 2020; King et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2022). 

Based on this, we suggest being cautious of the process smartphone use; moreover, future studies should investigate how and when the process smartphone use becomes problematic. 

Second, our findings highlight the role of academic burnout for linking stress and the smartphone use behaviors. Academic burnout is associated with poor academic performance and if left untreated, can cause depression (Cheng et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021). Besides, following the I-PACE model, this study adds that academic burnout serves as a response to stress and they combined influence the process smartphone use and problematic smartphone use. This reminds the educators of working out appropriate academic requirements that fit the web-based learning without placing excessive stress on the students. 

Third, this study supports the protective role of resilience for buffering the impact of psychiatric symptom on problematic behavior. 

Resilience is a capacity that could be trained (Forbes and Fikretoglu, 2018; Robertson et al., 2015). Therefore, future interventions could be implemented to enhance the resilience level of the students. 

## 5. **Conclusion**

This study offers insights into the influence of smartphone use types on problematic smartphone use during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of psychiatric variables including academic burnout in contributing to the smartphone use types and the excessive use. In addition, we identified the moderation effects of resilience in the whole progression. Future study should further examine how and when the types of smartphone use could become problematic; in addition, interventions should be launched to enhance the resilience level of the students.
