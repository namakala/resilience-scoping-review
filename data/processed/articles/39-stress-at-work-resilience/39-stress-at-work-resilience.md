Objectives. The job demands–resources (JD-R) theory assumes that job demands can be balanced by resources, which ultimately leads to the development of engagement and prevent burnout. Research shows that human resources weaken the relationship between job demands/stress and employee health. However, some reports do not confirm this. The overriding goal of the research was to empirically verify the theory of the buffering role of personal resources in the JD-R model with a sample of public administration employees in Poland. *Methods.* The participants were 144 administrative employees. The study was carried out in a correlation scheme. Correlations between the variables of perceived stress at work, burnout and ego-resiliency were established. It was also checked whether ego-resiliency moderates the relationship between perceived stress at work and burnout. *Results.* As expected, burnout significantly correlated with perceived stress at work (positively) and ego-resiliency (negatively). However, there was no statistically significant relationship between ego-resiliency and perceived stress at work. Ego-resiliency did not moderate the relationship between stress and burnout.

Conclusion. More research is required to test the role of different personal resources in the relationships between job demands and burnout, as well as between organizational resources and work engagement.

## 1. Introduction

'Victors, rulers and officials are always hated', Voltaire once said. The results of the Sixth European Working Conditions Survey show that employees in the public administration sector are one of the occupational groups most often exposed to situations in which they must face contact with upset petitioners, emotional discomfort and the need to hide their emotions at work [1]. The feeling of excess responsibilities, difficulties in cooperation with superiors, low salary and a lack of promotion opportunities have also been found to be stressful [2]. An engaged official can perform his work in the spirit of duty and devotion to another person, whereas this is not the case when he feels burned out. The question then arises as to how public administration employees can avoid becoming exhausted by their profession. The authors of the job demands–resources (JD-R) model [3] believe that the demands and burdens of professional work can be balanced by resources that ultimately lead to the development of engagement and counteract burnout.

The JD-R model has been used in thousands of organizations and has inspired hundreds of empirical studies [4],
becoming the leading theory of occupational stress [5]. The validity of this theory is also confirmed by the meta-analysis (of 74 studies) conducted by Lesener et al. [5]. Despite such solid empirical support, the JD-R theory still has some research gaps
- one of which is the still insufficient evidence of the buffering effect of personal resources in the relationship between demands and occupational burnout (health problems) [5]. Thus, the overarching goal of the research presented in this article was another attempt to answer the question 'Can personal resources (in this case, ego-resiliency) moderate the relationship between job stress and burnout?' This study was of a replicative nature (in the conditions of the Polish labor market), as the previous (original) study was conducted by other authors [6] - in India, and thus in a different cultural background.

## 1.1. Perceived Stress At Work

Stress is a phenomenon inherent in every type of human activity, including professional activity [7]. Basically, we can distinguish three ways of defining psychological stress: (a) as a stimulus, situation or external event; (b) as a reaction, especially emotional; (c) as a relationship between various factors and the person [8].

The last of the approaches, also called transactional, dominates in modern psychology [9]. In this category, stress is understood as an imbalance between the resources or capabilities of a given individual and the demands of the external environment or their own internal standards [9]. Following this approach, stress at work can be defined as a set of physiological reactions (such as increased heart rate and breathing, changes in the endocrine system) and psychological reactions (strong negative emotions) that arise when an employee notices that the demands of his work exceed his ability to cope with them or that they are on the verge of these possibilities [10]. In a situation where coping with stress becomes ineffective, the 'normal functioning state' collapses. When CONTACT Krzysztof Grala kgrala@aps.edu.pl, kgSD6@aps.edu.pl

this condition is prolonged, cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, hypertension), digestive system diseases, musculoskeletal ailments, decreased immune resistance, anxiety and depressive disorders, occupational burnout, etc. may appear [10,11].

## 1.2. Occupational Burnout

Occupational burnout is a state of physical and emotional exhaustion caused by excessive tasks posed by the physical or social work environment [12].

According to Maslach ([13,p.724–725]), burnout is 'a type of long-term response to chronic job-related emotional and interpersonal stress' characterized by focusing on people. Therefore, the groups particularly at risk of burnout, due to the specificity of their profession, are health care, social care, mental health, justice and education workers [13,14]. In the literature on the subject (e.g., Maslach [13]), burnout is often opposed to work engagement, which can be understood as an energetic state of involvement in activities that give a sense of personal fulfillment [15].

Schaufeli et al. [16] treat burnout and work engagement as two separate but co-dependent constructs. According to them, the three components of engagement, i.e., vigor, dedication and absorption, correspond to three symptoms of occupational burnout, such as exhaustion, depersonalization and feelings of reduced personal accomplishment.

## 1.3. Ego-Resiliency

Ego-resiliency is a relatively permanent personality trait that plays an important role in coping with the stressful events of everyday life [17].

Block and Kremen [18], the authors of the concept of egoresiliency, assume that people differ in the degree to which they consciously control their emotional states and behavioral impulses. Individuals with a deficit of self-control express their emotions and impulses regardless of the situation in which they find themselves. On the other hand, people who overly control themselves are often characterized by inhibition of action and expression of affect. From the point of view of optimal human functioning, it seems appropriate to adjust one's behavior to specific circumstances. For example, spontaneity and vivid emotionality would be desirable in the case of entertainment and fun, and concentration and persistence in carrying out professional tasks. It is this type of cognitive-emotional flexibility that determines ego-resiliency [17].

According to Block and Kremen [18], ego-resiliency, along with the associated construct of self-control (ego control),
are the basic personality traits that explain the functioning of people who deal well with stress and those who struggle with symptoms of mental disorders. Therefore, egoresiliency is treated by researchers as a personal resource that allows for sustainable functioning in various everyday situations [17].

## 1.4. Occupational Stress, Ego-Resiliency And Burnout In The Extended Jd-R Model

The JD-R model [3] is a development of earlier models of occupational stress, i.e., person–environment fit (P-E
fit) model [19], job demands–control (JD-C) model [20,21], demands–control–support (DCS) model [22], effort–reward imbalance (ERI) model [23] and conservation of resources (COR) theory [24].

Originally, the JD-R theory (developed 21 years ago) [3] was relatively simple in its assumptions: the authors maintained that each profession has specific risk factors (demands: time pressure, emotionally absorbing contacts with clients, etc.)
and organizational resources (remuneration, relations with co-workers, participation in decision-making, etc.), and that occupational burnout is the result of excessive demands that are not balanced by an adequate level of resources. According to the authors of the JD-R model [3], burnout consists of exhaustion on the cognitive, emotional and physical levels, as well as disengagement, understood as a as a lack of interest in work, perceiving it as insignificant and distancing oneself from it, colleagues and clients.

Later, the JD-R theory [3] began to expand its theoretical and research field to issues related to work engagement
(which is treated as the relationship between job demands and health problems as well as a mediator of the relationship between job resources and turnover [25]), personal resources
[26], internal and external motivation [27], time and selfregulation [28], personal vulnerability factors (external locus of control and helplessness [29]), sensory-processing sensitivity (perceived as personal resource and also vulnerability factor [30]) and even leadership [31]. The JD-R model has thus evolved from a theory focusing on environmental factors to an interactive approach that takes into account the simultaneous role of environmental and temperamental/personality factors.

The extended JD-R theory has already assimilated such influential psychological theories as the cognitive appraisal theory (perception of job demands as hindrances or challenges) [32,33], emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) [34,35] and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions [36,37]. These theories provide a better understanding of the assumed relationships between occupational stress, ego-resiliency and burnout in the extended JD-R model.

Originally, the authors of the JD-R theory [3] maintained that perceived job stress and/or burnout is/are a consequence of high job demands. However, it turned out that the relationship may be more complicated. Cavanaugh et al. [32] made a distinction between hindrance-stressors and challengestressors. The former (e.g., role conflict and organizational constraints) most often evoke negative emotions that are associated with lack of satisfaction, turnover intentions, turnover and withdrawal behavior [38]. The latter, on the other hand, perceived by employees as providing opportunities for growth and development, most often result in work engagement, job satisfaction and organizational commitment [38]. For example, in a study by Jiang et al. [39] with a sample of 226 Chinese public servants, challenge-stressors positively affected work engagement, which in turn translated into affective commitment. Jiang et al. [39] also showed that the indirect effect of challenge-stressors was maximal when perceived organizational support and core self-evaluations (a personal resource combining locus of control, emotional stability, generalized self-efficacy and self-esteem) were high. In addition, research by Mockałło and Widerszal-Bazyl [33] suggests that personal resources (in this case, psychological capital including selfefficacy, optimism, hope and resilience) may predispose to cognitive appraisal of job demands as challenges.

Yang et al. [35] maintain that skills related to emotion regulation can also be a valuable resource package within the extended JD-R theory. Here they point to cognitive reappraisal
[34], which involves transforming maladaptive and dysfunctional beliefs into ones that mitigate unpleasant emotional reactions and allow for more constructive actions in difficult and stressful situations. Another strategy is emotional suppression [34], which involves not showing negative emotional reactions at the level of the body, facial expressions and language, which is necessary in some professions (e.g., a psychotherapist cannot afford to overreact emotionally when working with a victim of domestic violence).

Also applicable to the JD-R model [3] is the broaden-andbuild theory [36]. According to this theory [36], positive emotions (joy, interest, satisfaction, love) are able to expand an individual's momentary repertoire of thoughts and actions, e.g., joy stimulates play and interest stimulates discovery. Positive emotions prompt the exploration of new ideas, activities and social connections, which in turn build physical, mental and social resources, which ultimately stimulate an even greater desire for exploration (reciprocal resource gain spiral
[24]). Rusu and Colomeischi [37], in a group of 1335 Romanian teachers, showed that a higher ratio of positive to negative emotions translates into personal flourishing, higher work engagement and higher subjective well-being. Sawhney and Michel [40] showed that positive affect can moderate the relationship between challenge-stressors and job burnout, but only if the level of challenge-stressors is not high (presumably, the relationship between challenge-stressors and burnout thus has an inverted U-shape).

Assuming that ego-resiliency buffers the relationship between stress and burnout, one can consider four interrelated pathways by which this buffering takes place: biological, cognitive, affective and behavioral.

Considering the first of the pathways, it is important to point here primarily to temperamental determinants: low physiological and behavioral reactivity, positive approach/ surgency (high-intensity pleasure, positive affect, sociability)
and high effortful control (activation control, effortful attention, inhibitory control) [41,42]. These temperamental factors not only reduce the risk of occupational burnout at the biological level (e.g., in a study by Rzeszutek and Schier [43], it was high perseveration and emotional reactivity that correlated most strongly [positively] with burnout), but also predispose an individual to good psychosocial adjustment [41].

As for the cognitive ways of coping with occupational stress in individuals with high ego-resiliency, it can be assumed that such individuals exhibit high cognitive flexibility and, via the so-called mapping system, are able to select such a mode of information processing that will result in an adaptive response (emotional and behavioral) to a specific situation or event [44]. For example, if an individual's goal is to cope effectively with occupational stress, and their current beliefs are maladaptive, then the information mapping system will calibrate their information processing mode so that the individual can perceive difficult situations not as hindrances, but as exciting challenges [44].

Individuals with a high level of ego-resiliency also have the ability to regulate emotions, meaning that they are able (with the complicity of cognitive information processing) to maintain (e.g., excitement) or modulate emotions depending on their chosen goal [45], as well as to 'repair their mood' relatively quickly [46]. Tugade and Fredrickson [47] showed that such people are able to break away from negative experiences and return to balance by arousing positive emotions
(the term resiliency stems from the Latin word *salio* meaning
'jump' and *resilio* translated as 'bounce back' or 'return to the previous state' [17]). In a study by Alessandri et al. [48], egoresiliency buffered the relationship between daily stressors
(hassles) experienced by students and their perceived negative emotional inertia (preceded by exhaustion).

Individuals with low ego-resiliency are more likely to exhibit behavioral symptoms of problems: internalized (i.e., insecure attachment, withdrawal, somatic complaints, ruminations, anxiousness/depression) and externalized (i.e., delinquency and aggressive behavior) [46,49]. Conversely, resilient individuals are more likely to be confident, optimistic, assertive, effective communicators [50,51] and proactive and courageous in solving everyday problems - including those in the workplace [52].

## 2. Research Objectives And Hypotheses

The study was carried out in a correlation scheme. The aim of the research was, first, to establish a relationship between perceived stress at work, occupational burnout and ego-resiliency of public administration employees. Second, the research aimed to see whether ego-resiliency will moderate the relationship between perceived stress at work and burnout. This allowed for an attempt to empirically verify the theory about the buffering role of personal resources in the JD-R theory on a group of public administration employees in Poland.

The hypotheses are as follows:
H1: Perceived stress at work is positively correlated with occupational burnout.

H2: Ego-resiliency is negatively correlated with perceived stress at work.

H3: Ego-resiliency is negatively correlated with occupational burnout.

H4: Ego-resiliency moderates the relationship between perceived stress at work and occupational burnout.

H1, about a positive relationship between perceived stress at work and burnout, was put forward on the basis of the results of research with Indian physicians conducted by Swami et al. [53], which proved that perceived stress strongly correlated with burnout (r = 0.54, p < 0.001).

H2, about a negative relationship between ego-resiliency and perceived stress at work, was put forward on the basis of the results of research with Egyptian nursing students by Elzohary et al. [54], according to which the correlation between ego-resiliency and perceived stress was r = −0.51, p < 0.05.

H3, about the negative relationship between ego-resiliency and occupational burnout, was made on the basis of the results of research with Korean teachers by Lee and Cho [55], according to which the correlation between ego-resiliency and occupational burnout was r = −0.59, p < 0.001.

H4, about the moderating role of ego-resiliency in the relationship between perceived stress at work and occupational burnout, was put forward on the basis of the results of research with Indian social workers by Stanley et al. [6], who showed that the relationship between stress and burnout was moderated by ego-resiliency.

## 3. Method

## 3.1. Research Tools

3.1.1. Measurement of perceived stress at work The Perceived Stress at Work Questionnaire (PSwP), created by Chirkowska-Smolak and Grobelny [56] and based on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by Cohen et al. [57], is one of the most popular tools for measuring stress understood in terms of transactions. The Perceived Stress at Work Scale consists of 10 questions measuring occupational stress, understood as an assessment of the employee's adjustment to his work environment. The answers are marked on a 5-point scale, from 0 = *never* to 4 = *very often*. The psychometric properties of the PSwP were analyzed in two studies with 537 professionally active participants. It turned out that the scale has a homogeneous structure and is characterized by confirmed theoretical validity and satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.84–0.87).

In the analyses presented in this article, the Cronbach's α reliability coefficient for the PSwP was α = 0.84.

## 3.1.2. Measurement Of Occupational Burnout

The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) questionnaire was created by Demerouti et al. [3], and adapted in Poland by Baka and Basińska [58]. This tool consists of 16 items measuring the two factors of burnout, exhaustion and disengagement, which together provide an aggregated rate of burnout. There are eight items in each of these subscales. Answers are marked on a 4-point scale, where 1 = *I agree* and 4 = *I disagree*. In Poland, the psychometric properties of the scale were developed with three independent samples, totaling 2216 people. It turned out that this tool has a two-factor structure (exhaustion and disengagement), shows satisfactory internal consistency
(α = 0.73 and α = 0.69, respectively) and stability (reliability of the total test rtt = 0.73 and rtt = 0.67, respectively), and fulfills the criteria of theoretical validity [58]. In the analyses presented in this article, only the global burnout rate was used, which was α = 0.85.

## 3.1.3. Measurement Of Ego-Resiliency

The Ego Resiliency Scale (ERS) was developed by Block and Kremen [18], and adapted in Poland by Kaczmarek [59]. This tool is used to measure ego-resiliency, which is understood as a personality trait that enables adjustment of the scope of self-control to situational demands. It consists of 14 statements, including 13 diagnostic statements, which measure one common dimension. The answer is given on a 4-point scale, where 1 = *does not apply at all* and 4 = *applies very* strongly. In Poland, the psychometric properties of the scale were developed with a sample of 1194 people. It is characterized by satisfactory internal consistency (α = 0.78), high temporal stability (rtt = 0.89) and high semantic and theoretical convergence with the original version. In the analyses presented in this article, the Cronbach's α reliability coefficient for the ERS was α = 0.79.

## 3.2. Participants

The research for the purposes of this article was conducted from July to August 2019 in eight local government administration institutions located in the Lubuskie Voivodeship. The institutions included three labor offices, two city offices, two social welfare centers and a district office. These studies were questionnaire-based and conducted on a voluntary and anonymous basis. The participants were 144 administrative employees. Among them, the largest group was inspectors (n = 34; 24%), followed by employment agents
(n = 27; 19%), senior inspectors (n = 12; 8%), social workers (n = 10; 7%) and administrative assistants (n = 7; 5%). The vast majority of the respondents were women (n = 129; 90%).

The age of the respondents ranged from 23 to 66 years (M 38.56, SD 8.94). Work experience in the profession ranged from 1 to 40 years (M 11.36, SD 8.98).

## 4. Results

The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics version 25. Since the values of skewness and kurtosis of the studied variables did not exceed ±1 (Table 1), which according to George and Mallery [60] implies the assumption of a normal distribution of these variables, parametric statistical tests were applied.

In the research presented in this article, the correlation between perceived stress at work and occupational burnout was r(137) = 0.61, p < 0.001. This relationship is quite strong.

The first of the hypotheses (H1) was confirmed.

A statistical analysis showed that the correlation between egoresiliency and perceived stress at work was r(137) = −0.12, p = 0.174. Although this relationship is negative, it is statistically insignificant. H2 was not confirmed.

In this study, the relationship between ego-resiliency and occupational burnout was r(137) = −0.19, p = 0.028, indicating that H3 was confirmed. Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis and Pearson correlation coefficients of the variables: perceived work stress, job burnout and ego-resiliency (H1, H2 and H3).

The last hypothesis (H4) was verified using PROCESS macro version 3.4.1. The method of bootstrapping with 5000 replicates was used, adding the option of standardizing the variables [61]. The results are presented in Table 2.

The model was statistically significant (F(3,133) = 28.22, p < 0.001) and explained about 39% of the obtained variance

of the independent variable (R2 = 0.39). There was no interactive effect in the relationship between ego-resiliency and perceived stress at work. Therefore, in the conducted research, the personal resource, i.e., ego-resiliency, does not moderate the relationship between stress at work and occupational burnout. Additionally, it was examined whether the interaction effect was in the group of younger employees, i.e., those with less than 6 years of work experience (n = 42). The model was statistically significant (F(3,38) = 12.11, p < 0.001) and explained about 49% of the obtained variance of the independent variable (R2 = 0.49). In this case also, there was no interaction effect in the relationship between ego-resiliency and perceived stress at work (β = 0.04, SE = 0.10, t = 0.44, p = 0.660, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.15; 0.24]).

## 5. Discussion

The overriding goal of the research was to empirically verify the theory of the buffering role of personal resources in the JD-R model [3] in a group of public administration employees in Poland. The research established the relationship between perceived stress at work, burnout and ego-resiliency. The research also examined whether ego-resiliency moderates the relationship between perceived stress at work and occupational burnout. The obtained results confirmed two out of four hypotheses.

Perceived stress at work was positively correlated with occupational burnout (H1), which is consistent with the results of previous studies (e.g., Swami et al. [53], Devebakan [62]).

Burnout was negatively correlated with ego-resiliency (H3),
which is consistent with the results of studies by Lee and Cho [55].

Contrary to predictions, the correlation between egoresiliency and perceived stress at work (H2) was statistically insignificant. In light of the research results, the strength of the relationship between these variables is reported as strong
(e.g., Elzohary et al. [54]: r = −0.51, p < 0.05), moderate (e.g.,
Kim and Kim [63]: r = −0.40, p < 0.05), weak (e.g., Klohnen et al. [64]: r = −0.23, p < 0.01) or having no relationship (e.g.,
Cole et al. [65]: r = 0.01, p > 0.05; Yoo and Park [66]: r = 0.07, p > 0.05; Jung [67]: r = −0.04, p > 0.05; and Lim et al. [68]: r = 0.04, p > 0.05). This is probably dependent upon the study group and cultural context, but otherwise the relationship between experienced stress and ego-resiliency seems to be more complicated. It is worth considering why the research conducted for the purposes of this article did not find a significant correlation between ego-resiliency and perceived stress at work. One of the explanations for this is the hypothesis that the respondents overestimate their skills and resources. Social psychologists (e.g., Wojciszke [69]) point to so-called illusory superiority, which is where the average person considers himself above average in almost every respect (an example question from the ERS is 'I usually succeed in making a favorable impression on people'). Therefore, the results in the questionnaires may differ from what is actually the case. Second, the respondents may not have given entirely honest answers, e.g., due to embarrassment (admitting not coping with stress or being burned out can be difficult - even to oneself) - this will be discussed further in Section 5.2. Third, there is also the possibility of experiencing high levels of stress and, at the same time, effectively adapting to difficult conditions. For example, in the results of the research by Jung [67], the correlation between stress and ego-resiliency was statistically insignificant (r = −0.04, p > 0.05), while the correlation between egoresiliency and adaptation to college life wasr = 0.39, p < 0.01.

Incidentally, negative affect does not have to be related to different aspects of working life. For example, in the research by Zelenski et al. [70], experiencing negative feelings did not significantly correlate with job satisfaction (r = −0.13, p > 0.05),
quality of working life (r = −0.18, p > 0.05) or even productivity (r = −0.05, p > 0.05).

Contrary to expectations, ego-resiliency did not moderate the relationship between perceived stress at work and burnout
(H4). There was no interaction effect even in the group of younger employees, i.e., those with less than 6 years of experience (n = 42) (the results of some studies, e.g., Lubrańska
[71], indicate that younger employees have greater intensity of burnout symptoms). This is therefore inconsistent with the results of Stanley et al.'s [6] study with Indian social workers. However, the research in this article was conducted in Poland, i.e., in a different cultural context, with a group not limited only to social workers and with the use of other measurement tools. A meta-analysis by Rattrie et al. [72] has shown that national cultural values can act as moderators in the JDR model. According to this analysis, five of the six dimensions of national cultures distinguished by Hofstede [73], i.e., power distance (PD), individualism/collectivism (IND/COL), masculinity/femininity (MAS/FEM) and long-term/short-term orientation (LTO/STO), can moderate the relationship either between demands and burnout or between resources and engagement. Comparing the indicators of these dimensions for India and Poland, it can be seen that India is a more collectivist and long-term-oriented country than Poland [74]. According to Rattrie et al. [72,p.201] this can intensify the relationship between resources and engagement and thus increase 'the protective role of resources against burnout'. This is one of the possible explanations for the results obtained by Stanley et al. [6]. Indian society, when compared to Polish society, also has a lower uncertainty avoidance, which means that Hindus accept imperfections and deviations to a greater extent from the prescribed action plan; unforeseen situations and events [74].

Therefore, they show greater openness and patience, which may translate into their greater adaptability [74]. For example, a study by Baig et al. [75] conducted among 193 employees of a large Southeast Asian commercial bank showed that the positive relationship between ego-resiliency and perceived mentoring was enhanced by weaker uncertainty-avoidance orientations and stronger collectivistic orientations.

Despite the fact that in India social work is considered an informal profession ('semi-profession') and is associated with low government support [76], work in difficult conditions, undefined responsibilities, variable working hours and low pay
[77], social workers excel in their duties and are proud to make a significant contribution to improving other people's lives [6]. Thus, the conditions of this work are more difficult than in Poland, which, paradoxically, may have a positive impact on performance and job satisfaction, because a high level of demands and a high level of resources boost work engagement and prevent burnout [78]. Interestingly, a metanalysis conducted by Hu et al. [79] showed that people who experienced many obstacles and difficulties in their lives had a higher level of ego-resiliency and mental health. Due to the informal nature of social work in India, perhaps people with a high sense of social mission and altruistic orientation as well as developed spirituality become social workers. A research team led by Newmeyer et al. [80] showed that spirituality can serve as a protective factor in alleviating compassion fatigue among professional mental health service providers working in stressful conditions in Kenya as well as increasing their personal satisfaction with their work (this has been called the 'Mother Teresa effect' by researchers). Moreover, the relationship between spiritual well-being and ego-resiliency may be two-sided, e.g., in a study by Son et al. [81] with nursing students, the correlation between spiritual well-being and egoresiliency was r = 0.45, p < 0.001. The role of the cultural context may also be indicated by the fact that in research conducted by Rubińska [82] among officers and employees of the prison service in Poland, ego-resiliency (contrary to predictions) did not moderate the relationship between sense of stress and the level of burnout.

It is also worth considering other unidentified variables in Indian studies [6] that could have influenced the significance of the relationships between perceived stress at work, ego-resiliency and burnout. Meta-analysis conducted by Oshio et al. [83] and Alarcon et al. [84] showed that among the Big Five traits, neuroticism most strongly correlates with egoresiliency and occupational burnout (r = −0.56, p < 0.05 and r = −0.42, respectively). Generally speaking, women reported higher levels of neuroticism than men [85]. According to Costa et al. [86], these differences are much greater for European countries (e.g., Russia d = 0.46, Germany d = 0.51 and France d = 0.71) than for Asian countries (e.g., India d = 0.15, Japan d = 0.09 or Taiwan d = 0.16). According to Wojciszke [69], the reasons for this differentiation remain unknown, but perhaps it points to a gender-equality paradox [87]. It is, therefore, possible that the women studied in India [6] are characterized by a slightly higher level of emotional stability, which, in combination with ego-resiliency, buffers the negative effects of stress. On the other hand, a study by Gunkel et al. [88] indicates that placing high values on such dimensions of culture as collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation (collectivism and long-term orientation are characteristic of India) may have a positive impact on the development of emotional intelligence, which plays a significant role in resilience and motivation toward achievement [89], is negatively associated with stress and burnout (r = −0.59, p < 0.001 and r = −0.29, p < 0.001, respectively [53]) and moderates the relationship between them [90]. Perhaps, then, Indian (public administration) officials are characterized by a higher level of emotional intelligence than Polish (public administration) officials.

## 5.1. The Scientific Value Of The Report

The presented report addresses the problem of stress and burnout among public administration officials in Poland, to which a relatively small number of empirical studies have been devoted so far (e.g., Basińska and Gruszczyńska [91]). This article also presents knowledge about ego-resiliency understood as a personal resource. According to Baka and Derbis [92],
the knowledge of personal resources in the work and organizational environment still requires supplementation. This is a consequence of the so-called 'cripple psychology' [93], which, by focusing too much on pathology (the 'four Ds' approach: damage, disease, disorder and dysfunction [94]), ignores the positive aspects of human functioning. So, we should therefore continue researching personal resources. The role of egoresiliency in the conditions of the Polish labor market was also relatively rarely verified empirically (e.g., Rubińska [82], Derbis and Jasiński [95]).

This report also highlights the problem of the inconsistency of the results regarding the relationship between egoresiliency and stress - the results of some studies indicate a fairly strong negative correlation between these variables
([54]: r = −0.51, p < 0.05), and others a lack of correlation –
even when the measurement of stress was based on a physiological indicator in the form of salivary cortisol levels (Lim et al.

[68]: r = 0.04, p > 0.05). Thus, it can be cautiously assumed that a given employee may experience a high level of stress, and yet be effective and productive (which may be indicated by the results of studies such as Zelenski et al. [70]).

This article also highlights the problem of inconsistent evidence regarding the buffering role of personal resources in the relationship between stress and burnout. According to Xu and Payne [96,p.226], 'multiple theoretical stress models propose that job resources buffer against the negative impact of job demands on psychological well-being; yet there is inconsistent empirical evidence for the buffering effect'. A similar postulate is put forward by Tremblay and Messervey [97,p.2]:
a closer view of the research on personal resources in the organizational literature [ . . . ] yields conflicting evidence regarding the role of personal resources as moderators [ . . . ]. More research is needed to better understand the moderating role of personal resources as it applies to the JD-R model.

The presented report may be a component of metaanalyses carried out in order to answer the questions 'What is the role of ego-resiliency as a personal resource in the relationship between stress and burnout?' and 'Does ego-resiliency play a buffering role and under what conditions?'
The advantage of this report may also be an attempt to explain this inconsistency in the intercultural context, not only in relation to the professed cultural values, but also to differences in personality traits (neuroticism), emotional intelligence, emotional labor and received social support.

## 5.2. Limitations

The conducted studies are not free from certain limitations that reduce their accuracy and require a certain amount of caution in interpreting the obtained results. One of them is the relatively small group of 144 respondents. The second is the uneven distribution of the sample in terms of gender. Due to the predominance of women in this group, the obtained results should not be generalized to the men. Also, the non-random selection of the test sample indicates that the obtained results should be approached with caution. Moreover, the research used only self-report tools, which, according to the author of the article, may pose at least two types of problem. First, respondents can easily find out about the purpose of the survey and may not be willing to give truthful information about themselves. Self-presentation tendencies may also play a role. Some of the officials, fearing that the director of the institution might have access to the questionnaires they filled out
(despite the anonymous nature of the data collection), might have provided not entirely honest answers. Second, it should be remembered that the responses obtained in these studies are subjective, and as reported by Nisbett and Wilson [98], people's introspective skills are limited, as they generally cannot adequately describe their internal states and processes. It should also be emphasized that the statistical analyses were based on the results of cross-sectional studies, not longitudinal or collected in an experimental model. Interactions between stress and resources are dynamic and long-term processes, and therefore only longitudinal studies, which would be more appropriate from the point of view of the topic of this article, could capture the dynamics of their development.

## 5.3. Future Directions

Further studies are recommended to test the role of various personal resources in the relationship between job demands and burnout, as well as between organizational resources and work engagement [3]. When examining the relationship between stress, burnout and ego-resiliency, it is worth replicating the research with the use of various tools and methods of measurement (e.g., self-report questionnaires, reports of subordinates and superiors about a given employee, physiological stress indicators of employees), various professional groups, various group sizes (small, medium and large) and different cultural contexts. It is worth observing at what levels (low, medium and high) the mentioned variables interact with each other, whether there are curvilinear relationships between them or whether these interactions are in some way dependent on the structure of a given measuring tool. It will also be desirable to produce systematic reviews of studies and meta-analyses that summarize the issue of inconsistencies in the buffering role of resources.

It is also worth taking a closer look at the working conditions of public administration officials. As Tabernacka ([99],p.407) notes, officials work 'with people and with regulations', and not only personality and interpersonal factors, but also structural and organizational factors may contribute to the occupational burnout of this group. Moreover, officials do not enjoy great public respect (e.g., the announcement from CBOS research from 2019 [100] states that in the ranking of social respectability, amongst 31 professions, an official was ranked 25th), which may additionally discourage them from working. In addition, it is recommended to develop preventive and health-promoting strategies for this professional group.

## 6. Conclusion

Although we have evidence of the buffering effect of personal resources in the JD-R model (e.g., Jex and Elacqua
[101], Van Yperen and Snijders [102]), there are also reports that personal resources do not weaken the relationship between work demands and organizational performance and health. For example, Xanthopoulou et al. [26] did not find that self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem and optimism reduced work stress and led to engagement. Instead, they found that resources mediate the relationship between resources and burnout or engagement. This inconsistency in research on the buffering role of resources is also emphasized by Tremblay and Messervey [97] and Xu and Payne [96]. More research is therefore needed to help us better understand the role of personal resources in the JD-R model.
