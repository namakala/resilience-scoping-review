## Abstract

Background and Objectives: Spousal loss is a stressful life event that often results in significant depressive symptoms, with men often experiencing more significant depressive symptoms than women. Recent research suggests that psychological resilience may play a role in shaping how well people recover from the loss of a spouse. This study examined the moderating effect of resilience on widowhood in relation to changes in depressive symptoms for men and women.

Research Design and Methods: This study used data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine a change in depressive symptoms for men and women who experience spousal loss compared to those who remain continuously married 
(N = 5,626). We used the Simplified Resilience Score, which is based on measures drawn from the psychosocial and lifestyle questionnaire. Ordinary least squares regression was used to assess depression following reported spousal loss for widows relative to their continuously married counterparts. Results: Results show resilience moderated depressive symptoms following spousal loss, but these effects varied by gender. Resilience was significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms for married but not for widowed women. However, for widowed men, resilience was significantly and negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and a high resilience score buffered the effect of widowhood. Discussion and Implications: Our study suggests that having high levels of resilience prior to spousal loss may help offset persistent depressive symptoms, especially for men. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

Keywords: Depression, Gender issues, Sociology of aging/social gerontology Spousal loss is one of the most stressful life events in later life and is often associated with development of significant mental health problems (Stroebe, Schut, & Stroebe, 2007). Although widowhood is considered an "on-time" event in later life (Elder, 1994), older adults who lose their spouse often exhibit increased depressive symptoms (Zisook & Shuchter, 1991). Some older adults recover relatively quickly following a loss, exhibiting little persistent depressive symptoms, whereas others experience lasting problems. Identifying factors that facilitate more rapid recovery from spousal loss is important because persistence of depressive symptoms relates to increased risk of mortality and morbidity (Luo, Hawkley, Waite, & Cacioppo, 2012; Stroebe et al., 2007), and lower quality of life (Coyle & Dugan, 2012).

Research suggests that men adapt more poorly to widowhood than women, and they are particularly vulnerable to depression following widowhood (PerrigChiello, Spahni, Höpflinger, & Carr, 2016; Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). However, not all women recover rapidly from widowhood (Carr, 2004), and not all men adjust poorly (e.g., Carr, Ureña, & Taylor, 2018). Research has begun to identify potential mechanisms driving variations in how individuals respond to widowhood. A  growing literature suggests that psychological

1122 resilience may be a key factor influencing how well older people are able to recover from stressful events 
(Manning, Carr, & Kail, 2016). Resilience is often conceived as a *process* of successful adaptation one goes through after facing a stressful or traumatic event, with those who have a good outcome described as "resilient" (Schafer, Shippee, & Ferraro, 2009). However, recent studies have shown that resilience also relates to *personal characteristics* (i.e., internal resources) that enable this adaptive process (Manning et al., 2016; Wagnild & Collins, 2009). To date, we are aware of no research that has examined how psychological resilience is associated with the depressive symptoms of widowhood for men and women. Our study addresses this gap using nationally representative longitudinal data to explore how level of psychological resilience prior to spousal loss shapes changes in depressive symptoms in relation to widowhood for men and women.

## Widowhood And Depressive Symptoms

Numerous studies provide compelling evidence that mental health is negatively affected by spousal loss (Shor et al., 2012; Stroebe & Stroebe, 1983; Stroebe et al., 2007; Zisook & Shuchter, 1991). A  temporary increase in depressive symptoms and grief following spousal loss is considered normal and common (Stroebe & Stroebe, 1983). 

Grief following widowhood has been found to be correlated with depression following a loss (Galatzer-Levy & 
Bonanno, 2012); however, grief is an emotional response to a loss whereas depressive symptoms are a global measure of affect and symptomology (Utz, Caserta, & Lund, 2012). Depressive symptoms are typically highest during the first 6 months following a loss, and decline in the months that follow. Symptoms can remain elevated relative to pre-loss levels for up to 2 years (Galatzer-Levy & Bonanno, 2012; Shor et al., 2012; Umberson et al., 1992). When depressive symptoms remain elevated beyond 2 years (i.e., depressive symptoms are "persistent"), individuals are at risk for more significant mental and physical health consequences (Onrust & Cuijpers, 2006; Shor et al., 2012). Persistent depressive symptoms up to and beyond the period of 4 years are considered chronic grieving, and suggest that an individual is coping poorly with their loss (Bennett, Smith, & Hughes, 2005; Galatzer-Levy & Bonanno, 2012). Identifying factors that contribute to poor coping is key to development of interventions that might help address this critical problem, particularly among those who are most vulnerable.

## Theoretical Background: External And Internal Resources And Resilience

There are many reasons individuals feel depressed after spousal loss. Widowhood disrupts many aspects of our everyday lives, such as social support, life routines, and financial status (Stroebe, Hansson, Stroebe, & Schut, 2001). 

Yet, in spite of these significant changes some individuals fare quite well, rapidly returning to their pre-loss mental health status in a manner consistent with a process of resilient adaptation.

Theoretical frameworks such as the social convoy model (Kahn & Antonucci, 1980) and the stress process model (Cohen & Wills, 1985) offer insight into the role that resources play in shaping adjustment to widowhood. Both highlight the importance of both the contextual and structural factors that influence well-being 
(external resources), and the role of individual characteristics and responses to stress (internal resources). 

Previous research has shown that *external resources* play an important role in adaptation to loss. A poignant example is social support. In later life, we become more selective about who we spend time with, and married individuals often depend more strongly on one another for regular social interactions, meaningful connections, and help with everyday tasks (Carstensen, 1995). We need others in our lives because we need help completing tasks, and to help process complicated emotions and to feel connected with others (i.e., instrumental and emotional support). Without these kinds of supports, we are at higher risk of having persistent depressive symptoms (Hawkley et al., 2008).

However, even when individuals lack external resources such as social support, some individuals still recover from stressful events such as widowhood. Recovery despite such deficits may relate to *internal resources*. There has been some effort to identify internal resources that shape responses to widowhood, such as self-esteem, perceived personal growth, marital dependence, personality, mastery, and coping resources, but results have offered inconsistent findings (Carr, 2004; Kahana, Kelley-Moore, & Kahana, 2012; Pai & Carr, 2010; Pudrovska & Carr, 2008; Yap, Anusic, & Lucas, 2012). These forms of internal resources have been shown to play a role in recovery from widowhood, but none of these factors have been shown to moderate the negative consequences of widowhood above and beyond external resources (e.g., Rhee, 2006). One internal resource that has not been fully examined in this context is psychological resilience.

Resilience can be conceived as a process. That is, people who do well in the face of adversity are described as being 
"resilient" (Schafer et al., 2009). Previous studies on widowhood have examined whether and in what ways individuals recover following spousal loss and have identified a number of factors that are associated with better outcomes. However, resilience as an internal resource relates to the personal characteristics that include the ability or readiness of individuals to adapt to adversities (Wagnild & Collins, 2009). Adaptive responses to difficult events relate to how well individuals mobilize the resources they have in ways that help them successfully recover (Schafer et  al., 2009; Wagnild & Collins, 2009). That is, they draw on a repertoire of resources and *activate* them in ways that facilitate good outcomes. For instance, new widows who have high levels of psychological resilience may activate an existing source of social support, or may cultivate new forms of social support to address their needs following a loss. 

They may also mobilize their inner strengths and capabilities, such as mastery, self-efficacy, and optimism to tackle new challenges (Wagnild & Collins, 2009). In other words, for resilient individuals, widowhood is likely to trigger the surviving spouse to activate both internal and external resources, which together result in effective coping (Schafer et al., 2009). Alternatively, those with low levels of resilience may experience a downward spiral because they are unable to activate the resources they need to maintain well-being.

## Gender Differences In Adjustment To Widowhood

Resilience may serve older men and women differently at the time of widowhood. Although married men are the least depressed of any gender/marital status category group (Lee, DeMaris, Bavin & Sullivan, 2001), when faced with widowhood, men tend to report more significant depressive symptoms in relation to the loss (Bennett et al., 2005; Stroebe & 
Stroebe, 1983; Umberson et al., 1992). Several factors might make men more vulnerable. Gender differences in social and marital roles might play a role in how one responds to the loss of a spouse. Older cohorts might hold more traditional gender expectations that could cause men to be more vulnerable, as they are losing their main social contact and source of care (Antonucci, Ajrouch, & Birditt, 2014; Lee, Willetts, & Seccombe, 1998). Older men might have less practice completing domestic tasks, making their new roles particularly burdensome (Umberson et al., 1992), and they may be more likely to respond in ways that are especially maladaptive, such as by engaging in negative health behaviors such as drinking and smoking (Bird & Rieker, 2008). Net of all of well-established gender differences associated with access to external resources and the structural forces that shape their social roles and social norms, we do not know whether psychological resilience moderates the effect of widowhood on depressive symptoms for men and women. High levels of resilience among men, for instance, may enable them to adapt better in spite of lower levels of social support, potentially causing them to more effectively mobilize support networks in their coping process.

## Hypotheses

Informed by current literature examining gender differences in widowhood and the effects of resilience in later life, we propose to test three hypotheses:
H1: Both men and women who become widowed will experience a greater 4-year increase in depressive symptoms than those who remain continuously married.

H2: Resilience will be negatively associated with change in depressive symptoms for both men and women.

H3: Resilience will significantly moderate the effect of widowhood on depressive symptoms for men, but not for women.

## Research Design And Methods Data

This study used a pooled sample of biennial longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). In this study, we used data drawn from the core "fat" files that were cleaned and processed by RAND for ease of use (for more information see Bugliari et al., 2016). In 2004, the HRS piloted a psychosocial and lifestyle questionnaire, also known as the Leave Behind Questionnaire (LBQ), which was fully phased in during the 2006 wave for half of HRS 
respondents (selected at random), and the other half completed the survey in 2008. Thus, LBQ questions are completed by each respondent every 4 years. Our sample was drawn from all married respondents who were age eligible for the study (i.e., 51+), who completed the entire LBQ in 2006 or 2008 (i.e., baseline) and again two study waves (4 years) later in 2010 or 2012 (i.e., Time 2), and who either remained continuously married to the same individual or reported becoming widowed at Time 2. Consequently, individuals who divorced and remarried another individual and individuals who became widowed and remarried were excluded from our sample. To address our hypotheses, we examine women and men separately. Our final sample included 2,877 women, 335 of whom became widowed, and 2,749 men, 136 of whom became widowed.

## Measures

Outcome variable Our outcome measure is based on a common measure of depressive symptoms, the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The HRS 
includes the standard short version, a count of eight symptoms available in the core RAND HRS file. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. Our outcome measure is the *change in CES-D*, the difference in depressive symptoms at Time 2 relative to baseline. We control for CES-D 
at baseline to account for differences in the level at baseline.

## Key Variables Of Interest

We have two key variables of interest: psychological resilience and widowhood status. To calculate psychological resilience, we used the Simplified Resilience Score (SRS) introduced by Manning and colleagues (2016), measured at baseline for each respondent. On the basis of a selection of questions included in the LBQ questionnaire, Manning and colleagues developed an index informed by the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (Wagnild &Young, 1993; Zeng & Shen, 2010). The original scale is not included in the HRS, thus the SRS is composed of 12 questions closely associated with original scale to capture the primary psychosocial domains of resilience. The SRS has been shown to be a robust instrument in this data (Taylor, Ureña, Carr, & Min, 2018). Each of the 12 items composing the SRS were scaled from 0 to 1 (i.e., standardized), and summed with a range of 1.929–12. The items are provided in Supplementary Material. In considering resilience as an internal resource, sensitivity analyses were preformed, testing the resilience measure against other internal resources (mastery, optimism, hopelessness, and constraints on personal control) in their connection to physical and mental well-being among older adults. The SRS produced as strong or stronger standardized associations compared to and net of these other resources, across all models and well-being outcomes (models not shown).

Our second key variable of interest is a measure of whether a respondent became widowed between baseline year (i.e., wavet-1) and Time 2 (coded "1") versus remaining consistently married (coded "0").

## Control Variables

We included several control variables. A key control variable for this study included *quality of social support*, 
which is a composite measure derived from survey items located in the LBQ. Individuals were asked the same questions in relation to their children, their other family members, and their friends. Given the purpose of this study, we only included a measure associated with quality of social support from friends. Seven items were used to create an index, including three questions related to positive social support (how much do they really understand the way you feel about things?; how much can you rely on them if you have a serious problem?; and how much can you open up to them if you need to talk about your worries?) and four were related to negative social support (how often do they make too many demands on you?; how much do they criticize you?; how much do they let you down when you are counting on them?; and how much do they get on your nerves?). Individuals were asked to indicate in relation to each statement: 1 = a lot; 2 = some; 3 = a little; or 4 = not at all. *Quality of social support* is the calculated total after subtracting the mean for the negative social support items from the mean score for the positive social support items.

We also controlled for a series of demographic and health factors. All time-varying variables were measured at baseline. First, we controlled for baseline year, which is a measure of whether respondents completed the baseline LBQ survey more recently (2008 rather than 2006). Race was measured through four dichotomous variables: *White* (reference), *Black, Hispanic*, and *Other race*. A continuous year measure was used for age (range 51–92), and is based on age during the baseline year. *Education* is a continuous measure of total years of completed education (range is 0–17).

We controlled for respondents' physical health using functional limitations, a measure of how many of the following five activities the respondents indicate they have difficulty in completing: walking one block, climbing one flight of stairs without resting, lighting or carrying weights more than 10 pounds, stooping kneeling or crouching, pushing or pulling large objects, and picking up a dime from a table. 

Our measure was the count of activities for which an individual indicates having difficulty (range is 0–6).

Finally, we controlled for the baseline health of the respondents' spouse as a proxy for the intensity of potential caregiving occurring prior to death for those who became widowed, or in relation to ongoing caregiving among those continuously married. *Spouse had a dementia diagnosis* is an indicator of whether the respondent's spouse had ever been diagnosed with a memory-related disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease or dementia). Spousal activities of daily living (ADL) limitations is a count variable ranging from 0 to 5 based on the number of ADL limitations the spouse reported having difficulty with at baseline: bathing, eating, dressing, walking across the room, or getting in and out of the bed or a chair.

## Analysis Plan

To address our hypotheses, our analyses examined women and men separately. We first used bivariate analyses to examine differences between widowed and continuously married women and men. To test our first and second hypothesis, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to examine the association between widowhood and change in depressive symptoms (H1) and the association between resilience and change in depressive symptoms (H2), controlling for all other factors. To test our third hypothesis (H3), we examined the interaction of psychological resilience and widowhood status to determine whether resilience modifies the effects of widowhood on change in depressive symptoms for women and men. 

To further address this hypothesis, we calculated and presented the marginal effects for widows and continuously married individuals by resilience score.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to test whether performing our analyses for men and women separately produced statistically similar results to performing the same analyses using three-way interactions for our moderation analyses (i.e., 
widowhood × resilience × female). Results show that the moderation effects for resilience on widowhood remain the same when examining these effects in two separate models as presented here. Further details are available upon request.

women, results indicate that widowed women report statistically larger increases in depressive symptoms (p < .001) 
than women who remained continuously married. The widowed women in this sample also reported lower resilience scores, and they were older and less educated than their continuously married counterparts. For men, being widowed is associated with statistically larger increases in depressive symptoms (p < .001), than those who remained continuously married. Widowed men in this sample also reported lower resilience, and they were older and less educated than the men who were continuously married. It is interesting to note that widowed women and men have lower baseline resilience scores than those who remain continuously married. However, as there has been no research on change in resilience over time, we are only able to speculate that this could be due, in part, to the older age of the widowed women, and poorer health of the spouse resulting in potentially more intensive caregiving that might deplete resources such as resilience. Future research should consider factors that could dampen self-reported resilience.

## Ols Regression And Moderation Analyses

To address our first two hypotheses, we examined the direct effects of widowhood on change in depressive symptoms 
(H1), and the direct effects of resilience score on change in depressive symptoms (H2) controlling for all other factors. Results are shown in Table 2 (see Models 1A and 1B), 
and indicate that both hypotheses are supported. First, for women, widowhood is associated with an increase of 1.132 depressive symptoms relative to remaining continuously married (p < .001), and for men, widowhood is associated with an increase of 0.862 depressive symptoms relative to remaining continuously married (p < .001). Second, in relation to resilience, each unit increase in resilience for women is associated with a 0.202 decrease in depressive symptoms (p < .001), which is very similar to men's 0.197 decrease (p < .001).

To test the third hypothesis (H3), we examined the interaction between widowhood status and resilience for men and for women (Table 2, Models 2A and 2B). Results showed that the interaction is significant for both women 
(p < .01) and men (p < .01), but the effect differs. To better understand these findings, we calculated the marginal effects for women and men, the predicted change in depression for widows versus continuously married individuals by resilience score. As shown in Figure 1A, both married and widowed women who had a low resilience score (i.e., a score of 4)  experienced similar increases in depressive symptoms (1.2 and 1.6, respectively) for more than 4 years.

However, married women with high levels of resilience (i.e., a score of 12) experienced a small decrease in depressive symptoms (0.5 symptoms). For widowed women, however, having high levels of resilience related to a similar increase in depressive symptoms as having a low resilience score (an increase of 1.0 depressive symptoms), a nonsignificant improvement in depression. This suggests that for women who remained married, resilience was beneficial to depressive symptoms, but the increase in depression associated with widowhood was not moderated by resilience (i.e., was not dependent on resilience level).

As shown in Figure 1B, resilience seems to play a different role for men in influencing the effect of widowhood on depressive symptoms. Men who became widowed and had low levels of resilience (i.e., a score of 4) experienced an increase of about three additional depressive symptoms, whereas their married counterparts with low resilience only experienced an increase of about one new depressive symptom. However, for widowed men, having high levels of resilience (i.e., resilience score of 12) substantially buffered the effect of widowhood on depressive symptoms. They experienced no increase in depressive symptoms despite the loss of a spouse, and their depressive symptoms were not statistically different than that of their high resilience married counterparts.

## Discussion And Implications

The loss of a spouse during later life is a stressful event, leaving many older people with poor mental health as they cope during the post-widowhood period. Previous studies have shown some individuals recover more rapidly than others after widowhood, and that men are particularly vulnerable to extended periods of increased depressive symptoms. In general, the ability to navigate adverse events in later life is dependent upon resources (particularly social resources) accumulated and cultivated over the life course (Schafer et al., 2009). The increased vulnerability of men during widowhood is largely assumed to be related to gender differences in access to social resources, however, less is known about the importance of internal resources in shaping how both men and women cope with spousal loss. Our study examined men and women, who were either continuously married or who became widowed, to explore the influence of a specific internal resource (i.e., psychological resilience) on depressive symptoms to learn whether resilience modifies the relationship between widowhood and depressive symptoms.

Our findings suggest that psychological resilience is an important and gendered factor shaping responses to widowhood. We found that for both men and women,

widowhood is associated with increased depressive symptoms and resilience with decreased depressive symptoms. 

Although resilience significantly moderated the impact of widowhood in both genders, the interaction terms differed in direction, suggesting the way resilience conditions responses to widowhood are different for men and women. For widowed women, high levels of resilience did little to reduce increases in depression following spousal loss. However, high levels of resilience protected men in the face of widowhood from increased depressive symptoms following loss such that they maintained or returned to their baseline levels of well-being. This finding of recovery is consistent with the operationalization of resilient outcomes after traumas or adversity (Manning et al., 2016). 

Conversely, men with low levels of resilience were particularly vulnerable to spousal loss, exhibiting the greatest increase in depressive symptoms across our samples. These findings suggest that internal resources, in addition to the external resources examined in extant widowhood research (Stroebe et al., 2007), are important for the patterning of responses to spousal loss, and especially among men. On the basis of the statistical significance of the findings, they suggest that there would be a clinical benefit of having resilience for those at risk of a clinical depression diagnosis, among those recently widowed. However, as a CES-D score does not have a standardized clinical interpretation, we are only able to speculate about the clinical significance of the finding.

There are several important research-related and practical implications for these research findings. First, research should continue to refine and examine the interconnection or substitution of resources when individuals are faced with later life adversities, such as spousal loss. We note that much research has focused on social resources in promoting adaptation to widowhood, but it is possible that internal resources consistent with resilient individuals may aid in the absence of social resources or may promote the mobilization of social networks to protect against depressive symptoms following challenging life events. Second, research should examine whether these resources can and do act as substitutes (internal and external) for deficits in certain domains or whether they promote one another (i.e., resilient individuals actively seek social resources when faced with loss) in understanding how to promote optimal aging.

In practice, clinical literature often strives to classify and target those who may be most vulnerable to negative responses following adverse events. Age-related health changes and social isolation are markers for vulnerability to depression in later life (Cornwell & Waite, 2009). 

Our research suggests that internal resources consistent with resilience are not only associated with optimal aging (Cornwell & Waite, 2009) but are especially important for older men in the face of loss, and that interventions targeted to individuals with low psychological resilience are important in care settings where widowhood is common among patient populations (Luthar &Cicchetti, 2000). Prior research suggests that internal resources, as well as social resources, are modifiable in adulthood and later life 
(Fiske, Wetherell, & Gatz, 2009). Caregivers, who experience both eroded resilience and social support loss as a result of caring for their spouses, might be a particularly important group to target in terms of boosting internal and external resources known to be protective in the face of spousal loss (Corey & McCurry, 2017). Helping older adults who are at risk of widowhood bolster their internal resources or protecting them from factors that may erode psychological resilience in later life may be an important route for targeted interventions for older men especially.

Although our findings provide a novel contribution to the current understanding of resilience and its moderating role on depressive symptoms following widowhood, our research is not without limitations. Initially, selection must be considered. The women and men had survived long enough to be included in our sample, suggesting that they were a robust group. In addition, as we compared widowed to continuously married, we were unable to examine the differential impact resilience might have had depending upon how the spouse died. The type of death, unexpected versus a long-term illness, could have varied consequences following the loss and might be drastically different (Carr & Utz, 2001). Moreover, our study design does not allow us to control for specific timing of spousal loss. Individuals who have recently lost a spouse are more likely to experience more significant symptoms of depression, and the moderating effect of resilience might vary based on timing of spousal loss. In our study, on average, widows experienced a loss approximately 12  months prior to Time 2. Future research should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between resilience and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, our study is unable to determine why having resilience is buffering the negative effects on depressive symptoms for men but not for women.

## Conclusion

Despite these limitations, our findings suggest important implications for future research and practice. Our research documents that there are significant differences between those widowed and continuously married, especially in terms of depressive symptoms, among both women and men. However, resilience appears to only buffer the negative consequences for the men. Future research should take a more comprehensive approach to understanding the gender differences following the loss of a spouse, including a broader range of external and internal resources. 

Furthering the understanding that resilience is a learnable behavior (Manning et al., 2016; Mealer et al., 2012), interventions that provide resilience training should be put in all major life-course institutions. Beyond suggesting that resilience is beneficial for depressive symptoms in later life, our findings suggest that bolstering resilience early in life might serve to better equip men for the experience of spousal loss.
