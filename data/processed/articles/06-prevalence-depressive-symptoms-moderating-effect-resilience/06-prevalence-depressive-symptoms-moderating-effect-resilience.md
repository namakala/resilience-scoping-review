## Abstract

University students constitute a higher risk population for mental health problems, especially for depression. Given the lack of literature addressing such issues in France, this study estimated the prevalence rates of depression, its sociodemographic correlates in French university students [FUS], and examined whether resilience resources moderated and mediated the relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms. Participants (N = 1435, Mage = 20.5) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Perceived Stress Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Descriptive, multiple logistic regressions, and mediation analyses were used. With respect to the BDI-II's cutoff scores, 20.3% (95% CI: 18.3 to 22.4%) and 22.8% (95% CI: 20.7 to 25.0%) were positive to moderate and severe depression, respectively. Gender and education attainment appeared to be moderate risk factors when accounting for cumulative effect of perceived stress and resilience. Resilience buffered and partially mediated the perceived stress–depression relationship. In conclusion, the prevalence of depression was higher in FUS, as reported in previous studies. The amount of academic and daily stress explained this prevalence. University students with low resilience level were more at risk. Interventions aiming to improve resilience skills could help to mitigate the negative effects of stress and to promote mental health in this population.

## Introduction

Depression is a common mental disorder across all stages of life, that hinders individual's somatic or vegetative functioning, emotional affects, thoughts, and behaviors [1]. Depression symptoms are reported to be prevalent among young adults. Particularly, university students constitute a higher risk population for depression than the general population. The prevalence rates ranged from 10 to 84.5% worldwide [2], and the pooled mean prevalence rates are estimated between 23 and 35% [2–6]. According to Rotenstein et al. [5], these rates increase by 0.2% per year. The short- and long-term consequences of depression are alarming, including suicidal thoughts or attempts, impaired academic achievement, and lower occupational performance after graduation [7, 8]. Beiter et al. [9] suggested the urgent necessity for universities to implement periodic surveys with the aim to evaluate the mental health needs of their students and to improve the efficacy of intervention-based programs. While these studies are expanding worldwide, in the US [9, 10], North-European countries [11, 12], Asian countries [13, 14], and African countries [15, 16], there appears to be a lack of literature addressing the same issues in French universities [17, 18]. At time of completion of the present study, we found the study by Herrmann et al. [18] estimating the prevalence of depression at 16.4% among French university students [FUS] whereas previous studies were restricted to generalized psychological distress rather than depression, specifically [17].

## Sociodemographic Correlates Of Depression In University Students

It is well established that depression is a complex mental disorder with various contributing factors [1, 19, 20]. In fact, international research has documented a variety of predictive risk factors of depression. In the context of university students, a substantial number of previous studies showed that sociodemographic factors (e.g., gender, age, marital status, levels of income) constituted significant risk factors associated with depression symptoms. Recent meta-analytic studies concluded for moderate significant gender differences in vulnerability to depression as females are more likely than males to report more symptoms of depression [2, 21]. Research also indicates that single / unmarried university students are relative high-risk group [19, 20]. There are important trends, but not in all studies [13, 22, 23], that younger students present the highest odds of depressive symptoms [6]. The effect of age is sometimes interpreted through the education attainment. However, it has been shown that first- and second-year university students may be more at risk [4, 13, 23]. This may be due to the amount of academic stressors that students encounter, in addition to the many interpersonal changes that occur as they adapt with their new academic environment. Bewick et al. found that university students from UK reported higher levels of strain during their first semester that declined as they progressed in their studies [24]. Similar findings have been reported in samples of Canadian [25] and Indonesian university students [14]. However, research also suggested that postgraduates or upperclass students often experience overwhelming stress related to preparation for professional careers and preoccupation about post-graduation life
[26]. There is also accumulating evidence that university students oftentimes encounter financial pressures, with those from low income families exhibiting greater levels of depressive symptoms and psychological distress [13, 23, 27, 28].

In sum, environmental factors involving academic requirements, adjustment to university academic environment, and financial pressures are generators of overwhelming stress [29] and risk factors for higher prevalence rates of anxiety and depression [9, 11, 23].

## Resilience As A Stress And Depression Protective Factor

From the perspective of cognitive stress theory, it has been shown that the way stress is appraised or perceived rather than the stressor per se determines health-related outcomes [30]. The perception of the "objectively" stressful situation is, to some extent, determined by contextual factors and one's available assets such as self-esteem, problem-solving skills, and resilience. With respect to individual resilience, it refers to the ability to challenge adverse and stressful situations and to maintain relatively stable healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning [31–33].

Building or improving resilience has been recognized to mitigate the negative effects of risk exposure and to promote mental health and well-being [34–38]. Yet, research on university student has paid less attention to the potential mediating and moderating pathways of resilience on the relationship between perceived stress and mental health-related outcomes. Among available empirical evidence, resilience has been described to buffer the impact of parental conflict in the development of mental health impairments [39]. Resilience was also found to reduce negative effects of psychological distress on the increase of depressive symptoms [40]. Although far from exhaustive, these studies suggest that individual differences in psychological resilience predict lower or higher subsequent depressive symptoms. In this view, promoting resilience skills in university students may help them adequately managing the daily and academic stresses they encounter, and in turn to prevent against the ravages of depression.

## Aims Of The Present Study

The present study expanded upon past depression research in university students to address the gap of literature on depression concerns in FUS. As it has been shown, a large number of studies have examined a range of socio-demographic and economic factors as well as stress-related risk factors of depressive symptomatology; however, the reported findings still remain mixed and inconsistent. This study sought to enhance our understanding on these issues. In particular, despite some degree of stress is normal and an unavoidable component of academics, previous work has focused on the sources of stress and number of stressors rather than the way they are perceived.

This approach by listing categories of stressors limits the understanding of interpersonal difference in effective coping abilities regarding these stressors. Moreover, this study extended the scope of existing research in this high-risk population for depression by testing for the multilevel role that resilience resources can play. Therefore, this study aimed to: 1) estimate the prevalence rates of self-reported depression symptoms in French university students, 2) examine sociodemographic and stress-related risk factors for depression symptoms, and 3) explore whether individual resilience resources moderate and mediate the relationship between perceived stress and depression symptoms.

## Methods Ethics Statement

Prior to data collection, institutional ethics approval was obtained from the Social Science Research Ethics Committee of the University of Picardy Jules Verne, Amiens, France.

Participants signed an informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2008.

## Procedure And Sample

The data were cross-sectionally collected through web-based questionnaires, from January to February 2019. Invitations to participate were posted on social networking sites (e.g.,
Facebook, Twitter) by associated research teams from many Universities, indicating the study purposes. Participants were conveniently sampled from several universities1 reflecting the wide geographic distribution for the nationwide sample. They were all students in faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, physical and sports activities science and techniques, literature, and social work). Of 1451 study participants, 6 who were part-time students and 10 who identified as either transgender or "other" were excluded due to inadequate proportion that could potentially lead to misinterpretation of results. There were no missing data. The final sample included 1435 participants. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the participants. Ages ranged from 16 to 43 years (M = 20.5; SD = 3.38; Mdn = 20).

Females represented 87.1%, somewhat higher than the sex-ratio of the French university population in Humanities (70–74% for female). However, these gender-related sample characteristics closely matched previous studies in FUS [41–43]. Females were younger than males
(M = 20.4 vs. M = 21.2, t[1433] = 2.86, p < 0.01). The proportion of first- to third-year undergraduates was 82.6%. Nearly 43% estimated their monthly income at less than 200€, 35.7%
between 200 and 500€ and 21.5% at more than 500€. The level of income increased with educational attainment, F[3, 1431] = 37.56, p < .001, η2 = .08, and depended on the scholarship status, F[1, 1443] = 26.34, p < .001, η2 = .02, as those who were grant owners (51.6%)
reported higher income than those who did not [48.4%]. With regard to the marital status, 78%
were unmarried/single and 22% were married or living with a partner in a committed relationship.

## Measures Perceived Stress Scale (Pss-10)

Participants completed the PSS-10 [44], a widely-used measure of perceived stressful experiences that evaluates the degree to which people perceive their lives as unpredictable, uncontrollable or overloaded. The PSS-10 queries respondents as to how often over the past month they have felt or thought about each of the 10 items on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, and 4 = very often). Six of the items are negatively worded and four are positively worded. After reverse scoring the positively worded items, a total PSS-10 score is then obtained by adding the scores on all the items. A higher total score indicates a higher level of perceived stress. In the present study, the internal reliability reached an acceptable level (α = .72).

## Brief Resilience Scale [Brs]

The BRS [33] was used to measure individual resilience. The BRS consists of six items, three items are negatively worded. Respondents rate each statement on a 5-point scale: 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. All items are summed to create a total score, after reverse

1 Most participants were from the universities of Picardy Jules Verne, Caen, Poitiers, Rennes 2, Lorraine, Grenoble Alpes, Lyon 2 and 3, Toulouse, Paris Sorbonne, Nanterre, Reims, and Nancy.

scoring of appropriate items. The French version of the scale was used [45]. The Cronbach Alpha coefficient was satisfactory (α = .84).

## Beck Depression Inventory- Second Revision (Bdi-Ii)

To access the current depressive symptoms, participants completed the BDI-II [46]. BDI-II is a standard self-administered depression screening instrument with well-established psychometric properties in clinical and community samples. It was designed for use among individuals 13 years old and older. There are 21 items rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3. The respondents are requested to endorse statements characterizing how they have been feeling throughout the past 2 weeks. The higher the summed score [range = 0–63], the higher the level of depression. The instrument provides reliable cutoffs which differentiate four levels of depression: 0–13 (minimal or no depression), 14–19 (mild depression, 20–28 (moderate depression), and 29–63 (severe depression). In the current study, the BDI-II yielded excellent internal reliability (α = .91).

## Sociodemographic Information

Additionally, sociodemographic data were collected including age, gender (male, female, transgender or "other"), educational attainment (number of years of university education),
marital status, scholarship status, and monthly income.

## Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographics and the scores of our main measures (RBS, PSS, and BDI-II). The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were estimated including 95% confidence intervals (CI) Between-group differences were determined by using t-tests, chi-square tests (χ2), and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Following this step, we conducted a path analysis, as a set of multiple regression analyses, to determine factors most likely to be associated with depression (dummy-coded: 0 = minimal or no depression to mild depression, 1 = moderate to severe depression), including moderation terms. Finally, to examine the mediation model, a similar method was adopted utilizing a residual maximum likelihood estimation. We conducted analyses simultaneously within one model including all variables. We performed moderation through multiple logistic regressions, and mediation analyses using R-program packages [47]. Except for the ANOVA, all statistical tests were two-tailed.

## Results Prevalence Rates Of Depressive Symptoms And Associated Risk Factors

The mean total BDI score was 19.0 (SD = 11.70, Mdn = 17.0). In compliance with the BDI-II's cutoff scores for the various categories of depression, 38.3% (95% CI: 35.8 to 40.9%) of the respondents scored in the range of minimal or no depression, 18.6% (95% CI: 16.5 to 18.5%) mild depression, 20.3% (95% CI: 18.3 to 22.4%) scored as moderately, and 22.8% (95% CI:
20.7 to 25.0%) severely depressed, respectively. The different thresholds of the severity of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with age (χ2 = 14.41, df = 2, p < .001) and educational attainment (χ2 = 15.46, df = 3, p < .001), but not with gender (χ2 = 1.13, df = 2, p = .302). Bonferroni post hoc comparisons showed that the proportion of moderate to severe depression was higher among younger students than among older students (+20 years) and similarly among first– to third-year undergraduates than among postgraduates. However, when accounting for the effects of perceived stress and resilience scores in the multiple logistic regression model, the effect of age was not significant (p = 0.218) and the effect of educational attainment tended towards statistical significance (b = −0.02, SE = 0.015, p = 0.097). Rather, gender emerged as a moderate significant risk factor for moderate to severe depression (b = −0.09, SE = 0.035, p = 0.013), thus suggesting that gender risk factor was influenced by the presence of levels of stress and resilience.

## Differences In Perceived Stress And Resilience, And Correlations With Depression

The total PSS-10 and BRS scores were 21.9 (SD = 4.33, Mdn = 22.0) and 16.4 (SD = 4.96, Mdn = 16.0), respectively. There were no significant differences in levels of perceived stress as a function of sociodemographic indicators, expect for gender (F[1, 1433] = 5.46, p = 0.02, η2 = .001), as males reported relatively lower PSS scores than females. Resilience scores were higher among male (M = 19.1) than female (M = 16.1) university students, F[1, 1433] = 61.97, p < .0001, η2 = .04. In addition, resilience scores were positively correlated to age, educational attainment, and level of income (all ps < .01).

As the results of correlational analysis indicate (see Table 2), resilience was negatively correlated to perceived stress and depressive symptoms, while perceived stress was positively correlated to depressive symptoms (all ps < .0001).

## Moderation Effect Of Resilience On The Relationship Between Perceived Stress And Depression

The interactive effect of resilience on the relationship between perceived stress and depression was probed through a moderator logistic analysis. All variables, including PSS and BRS
centered scores, sociodemographics step and the interaction terms [PSS*BRS], were entered in the model. The whole model was significant, F[9, 1425] = 52.76, p < .0001; R2 = 0.25. The interactive effect yielded a significant level (b = −0.25, SE = 0.001, p = 0.037) (see Table 3).

To examine this effect in greater depth through a graph, we used a multi-group comparison by splitting the centered score of the moderator (BRS) in three groups (+1 SD above the mean, mean, −1 SD below the mean), corresponding to high-, moderate- and low-resilient individuals, respectively. Summarizing the form of the moderator effect, Fig. 1 shows that in highand moderate resilient students, depressive symptoms were less severe than in low-resilient students. With the increase of perceived stress, the difference was relatively more significant.

That is, resilience was a moderator for the perceived stress–depression relationship.

Table 4 presents the mediation model with unstandardized and standardized coefficients. To simplify the model, the direct effect of perceived stress on depressive symptoms and indirect effect through resilience are shown in Fig. 2. All the path coefficients were statistically significant at the level of p < .0001. According to the model, the extent of depression severity was predicted positively by perceived stress and negatively by resilience; the standardized direct effect value of perceived stress ➔ depression was 0.28, z-value = 11.65, p < .0001, the standardized direct effect value of resilience ➔ depression was −0.33, z-value = −13.42, p < .0001. Perceived stress was inversely associated with resilience, with the standardized direct effect value = 0.30, z-value = −12.35, p < .0001. The results of bootstrapping test for indirect effect (PSS ➔ BRS ➔ BDI) = −0.011, SE = 0.001, z-value = −8.48, p < .0001. The total effect of perceived stress (PSS ➔ BDI, and PSS ➔ BRS ➔ BDI) was −0.04, SE = 0.003,

z-value = −17.57, p < .0001. In conclusion, resilience partially mediated the association between PSS and depression.

## Discussion Summary Of Key Findings

The present study represents the first attempt in France in investigating the prevalence of depression and its sociodemographic correlates among university students. Furthermore, the study extended the existing international literature by examining the nature of the potential role of individual resilience resources in the perceived stress–depression relationship. Using a large cross-sectional sample, we found that 20.3% and 22.8% were positive to moderate and severe depression (43.1%, cutoff ≥20). Through the multivariate logistic regression model, only gender and education attainment emerged as risk factors when accounting for the cumulative effect of perceived stress and individual resilience. The study demonstrated both moderating and mediating effects of the resilience on perceived stress–depression relationship.

## Interpretation Of Findings In The Context Of The Literature

The prevalence rates for depression shown in this study are mostly within the ranges that have been established by many recent meta-analytic studies [2, 4–6]. When considering studies conducted in some European countries, the prevalence of depression in the current study is, however, much lower than the 59% found in two studies in North-European countries, among university students in UK [11] and Ireland [12]. Indeed, previous meta-analytic studies [2, 5]
pointed out that the depression screening instruments used accounted for the important variability across international countries in rates for depression in university students. Ibrahim et al. suggested the use of BDI as it does not inflate the prevalence rates unlike other instruments [2]. This suggestion guided the choice of 21-BDI-II [46] for the present study.

Until then, the present study appears to provide empirical evidence that perceived stress is a core significant predictor of higher rates for depression in FUS. Several factors may explain the higher scores of the PSS-10 as reported in this study (Mdn = 22.0) compared to those earlier found by Tavolacci et al. [48] in FUS (Mdn = 16.0). In recent years, French universities have implemented important academic reforms regarding academic orientation, and revision of curriculum and programs, which may accentuate risks for stress and anxiety among students. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that increasing difficulties in career or job opportunities offered by the Humanities and Social Sciences area account for these concerns, as this may be a potential source of stress and anxiety related to career plan [26].

Fig. 2 Model with standardized path coefficients depicting resilience as a mediator in the relationship between perceived stress and depression
Sociodemographically, only gender appeared to be a modest but significant risk factor for moderate to severe depressive symptoms. This results aligned with several past studies summarized by meta-analytic studies [2, 21] and with recent studies [15, 22, 49], including the study by Herrmann et al. [18] in France. Importantly, our results indicate that gender differences reached statistical significance as long as the cumulative effect of perceived stress and resilience was considered. This finding provides new insight on the results of previous studies which report gender differences, but do not provide information about the potential causes involved in higher depression and comorbidities among females but not among males. The global explanation often suggested is that gender differences is multifactorial, encompassing biological and sociocultural factors, or variable combinations of each. Our result provides empirical argument for gender differences in the management of stress. Similarly, Tavolacci et al. [50] found a notable gender differences in managing of perceived stress. Psychological resilience is considered as a dynamic process; some sources of stress weaken resilience skills and self-confidence among females but not among males. For example, Beiter et al. [9] highlighted that academics and intrapersonal factors such as body image and self-esteem were significant sources of stress for females. As a whole, these findings open an avenue for further in-depth investigation. Apart from gender, our study did not provide sufficient support for other sociodemographic factors for depression. Given that a review of the existing literature appears to indicate that financial pressures increase the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation [10, 12, 51], it was surprising that, in our study, low income was not associated with depressive symptoms and stress. This result, however, is consistent with those found by Hubbard et al. [29] in the US. Further exploration is needed to identify psychosocial factors such as the family support that may protect university students with lower income against crippling bouts of [financial] stress often leading to mental health impairments.

The main relevant results yielded by the present study are the moderating and mediating effects exerted by individual resilience on the perceived stress–depression relationship. In line with previous research, resilience was inversely associated with perceived stress and depression [40]. In addition, it moderates and partially mediates the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms. This pattern of findings lays strong support that increasing individual resilience could help prevent depression. The moderation model revealed buffered interaction, reflecting that the more resilient the students felt, the lower their stress level and depression score, respectively. Again, resilience, functions as a mediator between perceived stress and depression, and had the direct effect on reducing depressive symptoms. It appears to weaken the path from stress to depression. Thus, resilience appears to help an individual navigate healthy in periods of stress, which psychological functioning. It is noteworthy that the results supported that resilience partially mediated the path from stress to depression. This implies that there are other mediators aside from individual resilience that reduce the impact of stress on the development of depression. Also, there are undeniably other factors enhancing resilience beyond the age of maturity, educational attainment, and level of income we found in this study. For example, Brailovskaia et al. [52] found in German, Russian, and Chinese University student samples that social support and resilience compensate each other. When there is no possibility to receive sufficient support from familiar social network, people activate their individual internal resources as protective factors. It would be interesting to explore in further studies if female university students, for example, counterbalance the deficit in individual resilience by social support received from familial and/or peer network.

## Limitations

It should be noted that, while this study used a large sample from many Universities, we could not ascertain that it is representative of all FUS. Future studies using randomized sampling methods will enable to confirm or amend the present study findings. Caution is needed in interpreting gender related findings. This is because the sex ratio in our sample was moderately higher compared to FUS in Humanity and Social Science Faculties. Nevertheless, similar sex distributions were reported in many studies among FUS [41–43]. Additionally, our study was not able to provide any information pertaining to transgender students given the small sample available, which would not allow reliable conclusions. Further studies including this group are necessary given that sexual orientation is not a negligible risk factor; a recent study indicated that it was associated with increased likelihood of suffering from severe depressive symptoms among Irish university students [12]. Finally, it should be kept in mind that the cross-sectional design of this research did not establish causal pathways between sociodemographic factors, perceived stress, resilience, and depression symptoms. Longitudinal studies are required in this regard and could be conducted among students from the first year to the end of their studies, with consideration of the stress factors associated with the studies themselves.

## Implications

Notwithstanding the above limitations, these study findings have implications for research, prevention, and intervention. For research, this study shows the need for longitudinal studies to better explore the risk and protective factors associated with depressive symptoms in students.

These studies should provide a better understanding of the pathways of students with depressive symptoms and the association between depression and academic productivity, anxiety about the future, uncertainty of professional life, past experiences of various forms of violence and in romantic relationships, the quality of relations with parents, among others. These studies should also help to better identify the consequences of depression in students and develop and implement prevention programs. Indeed, since previous studies have shown a positive association between academic academic productivity and depression [7], this study shows the need for prevention and intervention programs to first reduce the number of students with depressive symptoms. It also shows the need to treat them quickly and effectively in order to prevent academic failure and other potential consequences. The results suggest that promoting individual resilience skills could contribute to reducing academic and daily stress and in turn the onset of depression problems [37]. Prevention and intervention programs should consider both socio-demographic factors and perceived stress, as well as stress related to the studies themselves. Thus, there is a greater necessity for paying a closer attention to mental health interventions since recent systematic and meta-analytic studies demonstrated the effectiveness of, specifically, cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness interventions in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression in university students [8, 35, 53].

## Conclusion

The results of this study confirm that university students in France have a high prevalence of depressive symptoms. They also confirm that socio-demographic factors and perceived stress play a predictive role in depressive symptoms among university students. Specifically, high level of perceived stress was responsible for gender differences in the development of depression. In addition, these results confirm the protective role of resilience in students' depression and its ability to attenuate the relationship between perceived stress and depression.

As the first study focusing on depressive symptoms among university students in France, this study offers the opportunity for further research to better understand and act among university students to prevent depressive symptoms and associated consequences.
